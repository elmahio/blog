# Improvement #4 - Compact Toolbar##### [Thomas Ardal](http://elmah.io/about/), February 25, 2016This is the fourth post in the series [10 improvements in 10 days](ten-improvements-in-ten-days). Yesterday we [added two new products to the elmah.io Goodie Bag](improvement-three-two-new-and-fun-products-in-the-goodie-bag). Today, we wanted to improve both usage of space as well as usability on the error details.Remember the toolbar in the top right corner of every error message:![Old toolbar](/images/oldtoolbar.png)With todays improvement, the toolbar now looks like this:![New toolbar](/images/compactmenu.png)Using icons instead of the long textual tool buttons, saves a lot of horizontal space. You may think "Why change anything, since you already have a lot of empty space to the left". Well, in fact the old toolbar made fewer pixels available for longer message titles. Also we are planning to put some additional buttons up there, which would take up even more precious space.
