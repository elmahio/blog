# elmah.io 20131015 released##### [Thomas Ardal](http://elmah.io/about/), October 15, 2013## Once again we have been busy building the best cloud based error logger for you guys and girls.Here are the feature list:### New dashboardA lot of you have suggested improvements for the dashboard. We have listened and provided you with a new and hopefully much better and informative dashboard.![Dashboard](images/Dashboard.png)Each ELMAH log now shows a graph of new errors during the last 24 hours directly on the desktop. We really hope that you like it.### Tabbed searchWe have started splitting up different search entrances into separate tabs on the search page. There’s the search filters you already know from the previous version:![Search](images/search.png)The new statistics tab, which btw will be extended with new chart types in the near future:![Statistics](images/statistics.png)and finally a new shiny calendar view, showing you a calendar of the errors from the past 14 days:![Calendar](images/calendar.png)### Change log accessEver wanted to administrate log access on existing users? Now it’s possible through the new feature in the Users tab:![Settings](images/settings.png)As usual please reach out if you have ideas for elmah.io either through [UserVoice](http://elmahio.uservoice.com/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/elmah_io) or [Email](mailto:info@elmah.io).
