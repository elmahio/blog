# elmah.io 20131227 released##### [Thomas Ardal](http://elmah.io/about/), December 27, 2013## A new release of elmah.io is out there waiting for you. Besides the usual minor tweaks and bugfixes, we have put all of our energy into a single large feature this time.### Ignore FiltersIf you are a regular elmah.io user (or even ELMAH using one of the build in persistors), you probably see irrelevant errors in your logs from time to time. Errors logged from different web crawlers like Googlebot and Bingbot, errors generated from your machine etc. Getting an overview of your log, can be extremely difficult if a lot of irrelevant errors are mingled with the important ones. At elmah.io we experienced this problem and decided to something about it: Please welcome Ignore Filters!Ignore filters let you ignore errors which matches a set of query parameters of your choosing. Ignore Filters can be found on the Filters tab beneath log settings:![Ignore filters](/images/2013/12/ignorefilters.png)In the top you will see all of the filters already added to you log. Beneath the list you can specify new filters by inputting a name and a [Lucene Query](http://lucene.apache.org/core/2_9_4/queryparsersyntax.html). In the buttom you will find the section “Add template filter” which contains some of the most common filters to apply any log. In the above example, I have added the “Ignore Googlebot” filter to my log, meaning that no errors generated by a client with the specified user agent are logged.As usual please reach out if you have ideas for elmah.io either through [UserVoice](http://elmahio.uservoice.com/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/elmah_io) or [Email](mailto:info@elmah.io).
