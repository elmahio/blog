# ASP.NET Core Logging Tutorial##### [Thomas Ardal](http://elmah.io/about/), November ?, 2016Most parts of elmah.io consist of small services. While they may not be microservices, they are in fact small and each do one thing. We recently started experimenting with ASP.NET Core (or just Core for short) for some internal services and are planning a number of blog posts about the experiences we have made while developing these services. This is the fourth part in the series about the configuration system available in Core. If you want to learn about configuration in ASP.NET Core, please ready through [AppSettings in ASP.NET Core](appsettings-in-aspnetcore.md), [Config transformations in ASP.NET Core](config-transformations-in-aspnetcore.md) and [Configuration with Azure App Services and ASP.NET Core](configuration-with-azure-app-services-and-aspnetcore.md) if running on Microsoft Azure.In the previous posts, focus was all around configuration. In this new series, we will take a look at the new logging features in ASP.NET Core. Where previous versions of ASP.NET had hooks to capture information about exceptions and similar, ASP.NET Core comes with its own logging framework called Microsoft.Extensions.Logging. Microsoft.Extensions.Logging is available on NuGet and isn't bound to ASP.NET Core in any way. This mean that you will be able to utilize this new logging from Microsoft throughout all of your applications and services if you want. Logging is based on providers known from similar frameworks like appenders in log4net and sinks in Serilog. A range of providers are available on NuGet for most existing logging frameworks like NLog, Serilog and elmah.io. In other words, you don't need to switch to another logging framework, since you can always configure your favourite provider for a another logging framework of your choice.
