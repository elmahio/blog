This may not sound like a big deal, but it actually opens up for some features that other debuggers doesn't have. Having control on the application state, makes it possible for RevDeBug to step backwards in time, to help you find the root cause of a bug.While we love logging your errors, we would also very much like to help you fix and avoid bugs. RevDeBug is the perfect companion to your elmah.io subscription.
