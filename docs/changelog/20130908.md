# elmah.io 20130908 released

##### [Thomas Ardal](http://elmah.io/about/), September 8, 2013

We just released a new version of elmah.io. We have been busy building the best cloud enabled error log for .NET web applications. Here are some of the new features:

- A lot of you commented on the necessary URL when creating a new log. You now input a name when creating new logs, giving you the change to create logs like “My Site”, “My Site Staging”, “My Site localhost” and so on.
- A lot of style changes based on your input. Our responsive design now supports monitors with larger resolutions as well.
- Previously you would add a new user to your log using an email. You can still do that, but you will be presented with a search result, giving you a better chance to find the user which should be added.
- We fixed all known bugs. Please help us and report bugs on our [UserVoice](http://elmahio.uservoice.com/).
