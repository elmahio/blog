# New Advisor at elmah.io: Simon Langli##### [Thomas Ardal](http://elmah.io/about/), March 1, 2018<img src="/images/simon.jpg" style="float: right; margin-left: 10px;"/> Time for a new face here at elmah.io. This time I want to introduce you to a person, that you probably never will get a chance to meet: Simon Langli.

We are nerds at elmah.io and don't know a lot about sales and marketing (why we are partnering up with an external marketing agency). To move even faster on the sales side, we have found Simon, who has a lot of experience within this area. Simon will act as the first advisor in an advisory board that we are currently building.

Here's a few words from Simon himself:
"Hi, I'm Simon Langli. I have worked with sales in web-developing the last 10 years in different companies. I have sold webpages to all kinds of companies, like the small hairdresser to ministries in Denmark. The last 4 years I have worked as a consultant in different start-up companies to help them move from start-up to more established companies.I spend a lot of time trying to help start-up companies, to achieve their goals by making the right sales strategy to find the right people at the right time. I'm very happy to work with a talented and good guy like Thomas in elmah.io, to help him achieve his goals in the future."We are already seeing the benefits of our talks with Simon and very much look forward to continue working with him.
