# Improvement #8 - An Even Better Toolbar##### [Thomas Ardal](http://elmah.io/about/), March 2, 2016This is the eight post in the series [10 improvements in 10 days](ten-improvements-in-ten-days). Yesterday we introduced a completely new feature called [User Agent View](improvement-seven-user-agent-view). Today we continue to improve the message details toolbar.Remember last week were we [compressed the toolbar](improvement-four-compact-toolbar) in the message details? Well today you will start to see some advantages in doing so. As of now, the toolbar contains three additional buttons:![Improved toolbar](images/evenbettertoolbar.png)The burger icon opens the message overlay as previously, but the next three buttons are new. The first button triggers the [Extended User Details](extended-user-details) view. The second button opens the new [User Agent View](improvement-seven-user-agent-view) that we introduced yesterday. The third button opens the pimped [Status Code View](improvement-five-status-codes-with-a-vengeance) introduced last week.In fact no new features are triggered from these buttons, but we want to move everything clickable to the toolbar eventually. The Extended User Information feature has been available for some time, but it turned out that few of you actually knew about this awesome feature. Moving actions to the toolbar makes it explicit what can be clicked and what cannot.
