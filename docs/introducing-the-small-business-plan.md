# Introducing the Small Business plan##### [Thomas Ardal](http://elmah.io/about/), June 08, 2014## By popular demand we’ve just introduced a new plan: [Small Business](https://elmah.io/pricing/).We have gotten a lot of feedback on our plans and pricing. We realized that the gap between the Personal and the Business plan may have been too large. With the new plan, we now offer a great and affordable choice for small companies.Larger company? Here’s an idea for you: try out all of the great features of elmah.io with a few logs and users on the Small Business plan. If you like what you get (we promise that you will), you can upgrade to the Business or Enterprise plan anytime. No configuration changes are needed when upgrading, making the transition painless and without downtime.The full picture looks like this:![Plan](/images/smallbusiness.png)As usual please don’t hesitate to contact us through [UserVoice](http://elmahio.uservoice.com/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/elmah_io) or [Email](mailto:info@elmah.io).
