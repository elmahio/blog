# Improvement #10 - ELMAH Security Validator##### [Thomas Ardal](http://elmah.io/about/), March 4, 2016This is the tenth and final post in the series [10 improvements in 10 days](ten-improvements-in-ten-days). Yesterday we [gave away a 15 % discount on MyGet](improvement-nine-myget-discount-available-in-the-goodie-bag). Today we wanted to end this series with a big bang.One of the nice features in ELMAH is also one of the more dangerous. As default, access to your ELMAH logs (/elmah.axd) is available from localhost only. But using a small config change, you can actually browse your errors logs on a deployed website. Troy Hunt already [proved why open ELMAH logs are very dangerous](http://www.troyhunt.com/2012/01/aspnet-session-hijacking-with-google.html) and can be easily exploited by hackers. To help you secure your ELMAH logs, we introduce the ELMAH Security Validator.The ELMAH Security Validator lets you input your URL and seconds later you will be presented with the result of the scan:![ELMAH Security Validator](/images/elmahvalidator.png)The tool is available at [https://elmah.io/tools/validator](https://elmah.io/tools/validator).We'll do a follow up on all of the improvements next week. So for now, have a great weekend.
