# ASP.NET Core Status##### [Thomas Ardal](http://elmah.io/about/), August 3, 2016We know that we talk a lot about our integration for ASP.NET Core. But things are moving (and changing) very fast at Microsoft, in the community and @ elmah.io. A month ago we [released support for ASP.NET Core](/support-for-dotnet-and-aspnet-core) and today we take things a step further. The month old release contained an implementation of a logger for [Microsoft.Extensions.Logging](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Extensions.Logging/), able to run on Windows, Linux and Mac. The amount of data logged where limited to a date, a title and a few other properties. With todays release, we offer almost the same experience for ASP.NET Core applications like good old MVC and Web API apps.> Be aware that the integration still remains a prerelease. Both Elmah.Io.Extensions.Logger and Elmah.Io.AspNetCore contains an implementation of a Microsoft.Extensions.Logging logger. This will probably change in the future by using dependencies between the two packages.To start logging, install the [Elmah.Io.AspNetCore](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Elmah.Io.AspNetCore/1.0.0-pre-7):```powershellInstall-Package Elmah.Io.AspNetCore -Pre```Tell ASP.NET Core to use elmah.io:```csharppublic void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IHostingEnvironment env, ILoggerFactory fac){    app.UseElmahIo("API_KEY", new Guid("LOG_ID"));}```> The following code is no longer nessecary. Check out [Logging to elmah.io from ASP.NET Core](https://docs.elmah.io/logging-to-elmah-io-from-aspnet-core/) for updated documentation.Finally, register `IHttpContextAccessor` to make sure that elmah.io receives all of the data it needs to help you debug the errors later:```public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services){    ...    services.AddSingleton<IHttpContextAccessor, HttpContextAccessor>();    ...}```For more information, check out the [Logging from ASP.NET Core](https://docs.elmah.io/logging-to-elmah-io-from-aspnet-core/) article and the [example project](https://github.com/elmahio/Elmah.Io.AspNetCore/tree/master/Elmah.Io.AspNetCore.Example) on GitHub.
