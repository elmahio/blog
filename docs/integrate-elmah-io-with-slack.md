# Integrate elmah.io with Slack##### [Thomas Ardal](http://elmah.io/about/), June 18, 2015> This post has been adapted as part of our official documentation. To read the most updated version, please check out [Integrate with Slack](http://docs.elmah.io/integrate-elmah-io-with-slack/).Last week, we showed you how to [integrate elmah.io with HipChat](integrate-elmah-io-with-hipchat.md). This week we take a look at another popular tool for team communication: Slack. Like HipChat, Slack offers an API, making it easy to integrate with elmah.io through the Rules feature.Start by copying your Slack-token from the [API page](https://api.slack.com/web). We will need this when setting up the integration.![Slack Authentication](images/slackauth.png)On elmah.io, go to the Rules tab beneath your log settings. In this example we want a message on Slack every time a new error is logged in our elmah.io log. To do this, name your rule and input a query like illustrated on the following screenshot:![Add new rule](images/slackaddnewrule.png)Hit the Then link and select HTTP request. Input the following values (remember to replace YOUR_TOKEN and YOUR_CHANNEL):| Field | Value || :--- | :--- || Method | POST || URL | https://slack.com/api/chat.postMessage?token=YOUR_TOKEN&channel=YOUR_CHANNEL&text=$message&username=elmah.io |The final result should look like this:![Finished rule](images/slackrule.png)Click the OK button and add the new rule by clicking Add. This configuration tells elmah.io, to make a HTTP request against the Slack API, every time a new error is logged. The message at elmah.io is shown as the chat message inside Slack:![Slack message](images/slackmsg.png)
