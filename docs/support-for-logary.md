# Support for Logary##### [Thomas Ardal](http://elmah.io/about/), August 25, 2016Supporting all of the major logging and error management solutions for .NET is a high priority on elmah.io. Weather you use ELMAH or simple logging solutions like log4net and Serilog, you should get a great experience combining them with elmah.io. As the first online error management system out there, we recently released support for the up and coming logging library [Logary](https://logary.github.io/). Logary is primarily written in F#, but supports all of the languages available on the .NET platform.To start logging to elmah.io from Logary, install the [Logary.Targets.Elmah.Io](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Logary.Targets.Elmah.Io/) package. Be aware that there's a Logary.Targets.ElmahIO package as well. That's for the old version of Logary. Then add some code:```csharpusing (var logary = LogaryFactory.New("Logary.CSharpExample", with => with    .Target<Targets.ElmahIO.Builder>(
        "elmah.io",        conf => conf.Target.WithLogId(Guid.Parse("LOG_ID")))).Result){    var logger = logary.GetLogger("Logary.CSharpExample");    try    {        throw new ApplicationException("thing went haywire");    }    catch (Exception e)    {        logger.LogEventFormat(LogLevel.Fatal, "Unhandled {exception}!", e);    }}```The example is written in C#, since we know that most of you are C# programmers. To see a similar example in F#, check out our [Logary documentation](http://docs.elmah.io/logging-to-elmah-io-from-logary/) as well as the [F#](https://github.com/logary/logary/tree/master/examples/Logary.ElmahIO)  and [C#](https://github.com/logary/logary/tree/master/examples/Logary.ElmahIO.CSharpExample) examples in the Logary source code.Try logary today; get started by doing `Install-Package Logary.Targets.Elmah.Io`.
