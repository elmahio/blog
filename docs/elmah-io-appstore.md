# The elmah.io AppStore##### [Thomas Ardal](http://elmah.io/about/), January 15, 2016We have just started rolling out our new AppStore. Apps on elmah.io means integrations to different third-party systems, using a single click and a bit of configuration. As of today, we offer native integration with Slack, HipChat and RequestBin:![AppStore](/images/appstore.png)The AppStore is available beneath your log settings. To install a new App, simply hit install and input the App configuration in the App overlay:![App Configuration](/images/appconfiguration.png)In this initial beta version, Apps are backed by elmah.io Rules, which means that Ignore, Delete, Mail and HTTP Apps are supported only. In the future, we plan to extend this to support other types of integrations as well.If you want to develop an app, please [contact us](https://elmah.io/about) for details. We are currently working on documenting how to utilize the AppStore possibilities in elmah.io.
