# Deployment tracking for Octopus Deploy##### [Thomas Ardal](http://elmah.io/about/), November 2, 2016About two months ago, we [released Deployment Tracking](https://blog.elmah.io/deployment-tracking/) on elmah.io. Deployment Tracking gives you the perfect overview of the performance of your releases, in terms of errors. Last week, we launched support for [notifying elmah.io deployment tracking from Visual Studio Team Services](https://blog.elmah.io/deployment-tracking-multiple-services-and-vsts/). Today, we are ready with support for Octopus Deploy as well.Octopus Deploy is the perfect companion for .NET (web) developers. Having a tool made specifically for deploying software to multiple environments, is something that I've used and enjoyed on multiple projects in the past. With today's release, notifying elmah.io about deployments on Octopus Deploy is now fully supported.To start integrating Octopus Deploy and elmah.io, check out [Set Up Deployment Tracking](https://docs.elmah.io/setup-deployment-tracking/#using-octopus-deploy) on the documentation site. As usual, please get back to us with feedback. We usually implement feature requests and fix bugs within few days.
