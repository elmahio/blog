# Improvement #6 - Nicely Formatted Dates##### [Thomas Ardal](http://elmah.io/about/), February 29, 2016This is the sixth post in the series [10 improvements in 10 days](ten-improvements-in-ten-days). Last week, we made 5 nice little improvements to you. Today, we want to improve how dates as shown on elmah.io.All messages shows the date and time when the message where logged to elmah.io. We use the excelent JavaScript framework Moment.js to show a nicely formatted date and time:![Date and time](/images/httpstatuscode.png)In the example above, the message where logged _8 days ago_. Sometimes, _8 days ago_ simply doesn't provide enough information and you want to see the exact date and time of that particular message. We previously had a pretty awful ToString representation when hovering the date. With todays improvment, we generate a nicely formatted (browser locale aware) tooltip:![Nicely formatted date](/images/dateformat.png)This change is available in both the list, the error details and in the error page available through the permalink.
