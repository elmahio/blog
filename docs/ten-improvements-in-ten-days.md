# 10 improvements in 10 days##### [Thomas Ardal](http://elmah.io/about/), February 15, 2016 The following 2 weeks, we want to try something new: making a daily improvement to elmah.io and blog about it. We constantly make adjustments to the UI and create small features, that aren't really highlighted anywhere. With an approach like this, you will be able to follow the daily work of making elmah.io the most crisp [.NET cloud logging](https://elmah.io/cloud-logging/) experience out there.To be honest, we didn't came up with this idea ourselves. One of our competitors did a similar thing last year and we liked the idea so much, that we are going to try it our for ourselves. If the series turns out a success, we may start blogging more about the small things. For now, you can expect 10 days of action-packed improvements to elmah.io, starting next Monday.
