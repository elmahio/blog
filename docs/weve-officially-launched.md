# We’ve officially launched##### [Thomas Ardal](http://elmah.io/about/), April 24, 2014## It’s a great day for elmah.io! The beta sign is gone and a lot of exiting stuff have happened since the first alpha. We really think that we have built a product, which will save you hours and make your everyday fun and focused.Why this post then? Along the official launch, we’re also ready to introduce paid plans on elmah.io. Luckily for all of you beta testers, we still offer a free plan and all of your logs are automatically moved to the free plan. So why introduce pricing at all? Well as you probably know, running a website isn’t free. To keep the releases flowing and to give us a change to innovate on this already awesome platform, we really hope that you will consider supporting us, by purchasing one of our paid plans. We have a lot of ideas on how to make elmah.io even cooler and we need your help to do that. Check out the Plans and Pricing page for details. To purchase a plan, log in to elmah.io and visit the profile page.If you haven’t visited us for a while, let us use a few lines to introduce some of the great features we have been building recently. In November we introduced [Lucene search](http://blog.elmah.io/elmah-io-20131111-released/), making it possible to write advanced queries against your errors. In December we gave you the much sought [HTTPS support](http://blog.elmah.io/elmah-io-20131212-released/). In January [Ignore Filters](http://blog.elmah.io/elmah-io-20131227-released/) which later on matured into an [advanced rule engine](http://blog.elmah.io/elmah-io-20140315-released/), making it possible for you to react through mail and/or web hooks, when new errors occur. Recently we introduced the new [Overview tab](http://blog.elmah.io/elmah-io-20140412-released/), which in a simple way visualizes your recent error activity.As usual please reach out if you have ideas for elmah.io either through [UserVoice](http://elmahio.uservoice.com/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/elmah_io) or [Email](mailto:info@elmah.io).Thank you for your support!
