# Installation Help Directly Inside elmah.io##### [Thomas Ardal](http://elmah.io/about/), June 9, 2016Error management without any errors, doesn't sound like a lot of fun, right? Without configuration on your website, nothing is shipped off to elmah.io. While installing elmah.io has always been as simple as installing a NuGet package, sometimes you get extra benefits by adding additional NuGet packages and configuration, depending on your web- and/or logging-framework of choice.While we've had our [documentation site](http://docs.elmah.io/) for quite some time now, we always wanted to provide something even better. Today, we are ready to introduce installation and configuration documentation directly in the elmah.io UI. When creating a new log, you are redirected to the installation page as previous, but now we provide even more help:![Language and Framework](/images/language-and-framework.png)Notice the new language and framework selector in the top. As default we show the generic and most simple installation steps as before, but for additional help setting up elmah.io on a specific web- or logging-framework, all you need to do is clicking one of the framework buttons. Let's say you want to use elmah.io from Serilog, simply click the Serilog button and the documentation is right there in the browser:![Installing using Serilog](/images/installation-serilog.png)Behind the three dotted button, additional frameworks are available.
