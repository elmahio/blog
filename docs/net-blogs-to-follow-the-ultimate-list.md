# .NET blogs to follow - The ultimate list

##### [Thomas Ardal](http://elmah.io/about/), November 17, 2017
 
Back in the days, books were the only way to gain knowledge. I remember spending hundreds of hours in book stores and in the local library, digging up old books about programming. Fast forward to 2017 and my focus has almost entirely shifted to blogs. Here's my personal list of my recommendations for .NET blogs to follow.

## Personal blogs

### Scott Hanselman

Really don't need any introduction. Scott's blog is one of the best resources for .NET developers. Besides blogging about .NET, Scott also writes a lot of interesting posts about productivity.

### Michael Crump

URL: [https://www.michaelcrump.net/](https://www.michaelcrump.net/)

With his _Azure Tips and Tricks_ series (currently 50 posts), Michael's blog is packed with good stuff about Microsoft Azure.

### Troy Hunt

Much like Hanselman, Troy is a well known blogger among .NET developers. If you haven't starting looking into security, Troy's blog is a great place to start. Besides blogging, Troy is the founder of a number of great tools like [Have I been pwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com/) and [ASafaWeb](https://asafaweb.com/).

### CodeOpinion
Microsoft MVP Derek Comartin is writing a lot of interesting posts, primarily around .NET. If you are into CQRS, Derek is writing a lot about the subject too.

### Software Engineering

Everyone is talking about ASP.NET Core, right? Well, if you want to know more, Damien's blog contain a lot of good stuff.

### Talking Dotnet

Doesn't really seem like a personal blog, but cannot figure out if it's a company blog or not. With that said, Talking Dotnet offers some great posts about ASP.NET and related technologies.

### Mads Kristensen

I have been following Mads, a fellow dane, for years. Mads blogs a lot about web technologies and standards. He have been quiet for a couple of years, but it seems like a newly found love for ASP.NET Core, result in a range of new blog posts from Mads.

### Iris Classon

URL: [http://irisclasson.com/](http://irisclasson.com/)

The "happiest developer" in the world MVP Iris Classon writes a lot of good posts. You can catch Iris as a speaker on a lot of international conferences as well.

### Steve Sanderson

Microsoft employee Steve isn't the most productive blogger. But when he writes, I listen. Steve is the founder of Knockout.js, which is a great MVVM framework for JavaScript. React and Angular may have received all attention during the last years, but Knockout still just works.

### You've Been Haacked

URL: [https://haacked.com/](https://haacked.com/)

If you are using any variant of ASP.NET, you are probably running on this guys code. Phil were part of the team creating ASP.NET MVC at Microsoft, but have worked for GitHub the recent years. While the number of .NET related blog posts drastically decreased when Phil moved to GitHub, the posts are still very high quality.

### Ben Foster

URL: [http://benfoster.io/blog](http://benfoster.io/blog)

Much like Steve Snaderson, Ben doesn't blog a whole lot. But when he do, the posts are always long, thorough and very high quality. Ben blogs primarily around Azure and ASP.NET Core.

### DotNetNerd

Christian writes a lot of good posts about .NET. I've learned a lot about ASP.NET Core from Christian and his blog. Recently, he seems to have found a new love of his life: TypeScript.

URL: [http://blog.dotnetnerd.dk/](http://blog.dotnetnerd.dk/)

### Dusted Codes

The impressive thing about Dustin's blog is, that I don't even need to follow it. Every time I google some kind of ASP.NET related subject, I end up on Dustin's blog anyway :) This is definitely one of my go to blogs for ASP.NET (Core).

URL: [https://dusted.codes/](https://dusted.codes/)

### mookid on code

If Iris is the "happiest programmer on the planet", Mogens is probably "the nicest". Besides being nice, Mogens is a talented .NET developer with a lot of good blog posts in the bagage. Besides blogging, Mogens is the founder of [Rebus](https://rebus.fm/), the best service bus for .NET (IMO).

URL: [http://mookid.dk/oncode/](http://mookid.dk/oncode/)

### the codeface

Another blogger with awesome posts is Mark Rendle. If you're into ASP.NET, you will never be disappointed after leaving one of Mark's posts.

### Thomas Ardal

You got me! That's actually my personal blog. After founding elmah.io, I don't blog as much as previously, but I try to write at least a few posts every year. I blog primarily around .NET, processes and personal productivity.

## Correlators

### The Morning Brew

URL: [http://blog.cwa.me.uk/](http://blog.cwa.me.uk/)

Chris Alcock probably offer the best daily correlation of .NET related blog posts. I cannot even imagine how much time and energy this guy needs to put into producing a daily digest like this.

### Alvin Ashcraft's Morning Dew

Much like Chris' blog, Morning Dew is a daily digest of online content produced since yesterday. New is broader than The Morning Brew and contains links to mobile posts as well.

URL: [https://www.alvinashcraft.com/](https://www.alvinashcraft.com/)

## Company blogs

### Microsoft MVP Award Program Blog

A chance for Microsoft MVP's to write blog posts. There's a large fluctuation in the subjects, but a number of good posts for sure.

URL: [https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/mvpawardprogram/](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/mvpawardprogram/)

### .NET Blog

A must follow for every .NET developer. Stay up to date on the new things going on.

URL: [https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/)

### The Visual Studio Blog

If you're using Visual Studio, the Visual Studio Blog is a good place to stay informed about new versions and features.

URL: [https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/visualstudio/](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/visualstudio/)

### elmah.io Blog

It wouldn't be a very good post, without a reference to our very own blog. On the elmah.io blog, you will not only find posts about new features. We love writing about technologies that we find and use to build elmah.io.
