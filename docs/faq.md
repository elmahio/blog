More details here: [ELMAH and elmah.io differences](https://docs.elmah.io/elmah-and-elmah-io-differences/).**Is elmah.io developed by the guys developing ELMAH?**No. A group of talented developers are maintaining and doing new development of ELMAH. elmah.io is maintained by us, though we love to help out on the ELMAH framework as well. Lucky for us, the maintainers behind ELMAH have been kind enough to send us multiple pull requests on the parts of elmah.io which are open source.**Is elmah.io open source?**Yes and no. The persistence part and the elmah.io website are not open source. We open sourced a couple of the components we have written in order to make elmah.io work, as well as our NuGet packages for logging errors to elmah.io.A lot of the internals of elmah.io are based on open source and we love making contributions to other projects.**Is elmah.io supported in other languages than .NET?**elmah.io builds on top of ELMAH, which is an error logging framework for .NET web applications. Integrating with elmah.io from other languages than .NET is possible, if someone wrote an integration for ELMAH from that language or web framework. If no integrations are there, you can use our API to manually log errors to elmah.io.**Can I browse errors from outside elmah.io?**There are a few options for browsing through your errors, without visiting elmah.io:* Using the Rules tab of the log settings, you can execute custom rules each time a new error occurs. This way you can send yourself an email or make a HTTP request when new errors are logged.* ELMAH offers an error browser as well. This browser is available by visiting /elmah.axd on your own site (available for ASP.NET / MVC / Web API only).* Weâ€™ve developed an [elmah.io Visual Studio extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ThomasArdal.elmahio), making it possible to browse your log(s) from within Visual Studio.* Finally we provide an [API](http://api.elmah.io/swagger/ui/index), making it possible to integrate anything with elmah.io. Please let us know if you build something cool.## Installation**Which (web)frameworks support elmah.io?**Every framework supporting ELMAH also supports elmah.io. Besides these, we maintain a range of integrations for popular logging frameworks like log4net, NLog and Serilog. We do a lot to test elmah.io with as many frameworks as possible and love blogging about it. Find out how to integrate with elmah.io from various frameworks, by visiting [docs.elmah.io](https://docs.elmah.io).**The Input API key and Log Id dialog doesn't show during install. Why not?**Hard to say, but most likely this issue is caused by one of two reasons:1. You already have elmah.io configuration in your web.config file. Look for the <errorLog> element.2. Powershell does not have sufficient privileges to execute the install.ps1 script from the elmah.io NuGet package. Start Visual Studio as administrator or set [ExecutionPolicy](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/SigningPowerShellScripts.aspx).**My website isn't logging errors to elmah.io. What's wrong?**Could be one of many reasons. You should check the following:* Your project references both elmah.dll and elmah.io.dll* Your web.config contains the needed configuration. Use the [ELMAH config validator](https://elmah.io/tools/configvalidator) to check.* You are referencing the most recent version of the [elmah.io NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/elmah.io/).* The server hosting your website is able to invoke HTTPS requests on https://elmah.io/ or https://api.elmah.io/.## Payment**Can I upgrade my subscription after I sign up?**Of course.
