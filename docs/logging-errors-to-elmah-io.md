When logged in, elmah.io redirects you to the dashboard. Click on Create new log and name your log:![Step 3](images/loggingtoelmahiostep3.png)4. When created, elmah.io shows you the install instructions. Don’t pay too much attention to the install steps, because the rest of this tutorial will guide you through the installation. Copy your log id from step 2 in the installation instructions (located in the dialog):![Step 4](images/loggingtoelmahiostep4.png)5.
