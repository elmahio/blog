# New release cycle

##### [Thomas Ardal](http://elmah.io/about/), May 2, 2014 in [Changelog](/category/changelog/)

## As you probably noticed, we have been releasing a new version of elmah.io once every month pretty much since we launched last year. From today we will change our release cycle to release every time we have a new feature or bug request implemented and tested. This way you will get the new stuff way faster than you do today.

This also means that we will stop posting the monthly changelog of new features and bugfixes. No one really wants a ping every time we fix a bug but from today, we will start writing individual blog posts, when we launch new features that we believe you will find interesting. Expect a new post about our new alpha release of the [elmah.io Visual Studio extension](http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/0225db2a-9074-45eb-a4be-d1cf42d6a94d) coming up.

Some periods may provide you with more posts about new features and some the opposite. Rest assured that we do everything in our power to make elmah.io the best option for adding cloud logging to .NET web applications. We constantly innovate with new features and prioritize tasks stabilizing the platform. If you want to support the further development of elmah.io, you should consider purchasing one of our [paid plans](https://elmah.io/pricing/).
