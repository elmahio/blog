# 10 Improvements in 10 Days Roundup##### [Thomas Ardal](http://elmah.io/about/), March 8, 2018During the last two weeks, we have tried something new with our [10 Improvements in 10 Days](ten-improvements-in-ten-days) series. The idea were to implement a small improvement every week day. To sum up, a lot of good stuff have been added to elmah.io.Three new products have been added to the [Goodie Bag](https://elmah.io/goodiebag), our discount bag for Business and Enterprise customers. Wednesday in week 1, [Programming Languages ABC++ and Release!](improvement-three-two-new-and-fun-products-in-the-goodie-bag) were added, while [MyGet](improvement-nine-myget-discount-available-in-the-goodie-bag) were added Thursday in week 2.The message details view have been heavily improved as well, with the [compact](improvement-four-compact-toolbar) and [improved toolbar](improvement-eight-an-even-better-toolbar), a new [status code view](improvement-five-status-codes-with-a-vengeance), [nicely formatted dates](improvement-six-nicely-formatted-dates) and [HTTP methods](improvement-one-http-method-on-urls) as well as the new [user agent view](improvement-seven-user-agent-view).Tuesday in week 1, we [increased the session timeout](improvement-two-increased-session-timeout) and to round it all of, we implemented the new [ELMAH Security Validator](improvement-ten-elmah-security-validator), available for everyone to use.Focusing on the small things have been a great experience and definitely something that we want to do again.
