## Time for another update on new elmah.io features.

### API 
A lot of you asked for it. Now it’s there! The new [API](http://elmah.io/api/) makes it possible to integrate with elmah.io from your own code. We’ve published three examples on how to integrate with elmah.io at our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/elmahio/Elmah.Io.Examples).

### Browser and OS icons on error details
Show which browser and OS the user generating this error were using. Helps you spot trends in errors relating to certain browsers or operating systems.

By popular request, we’ve moved the “dangerous” methods like Clear and Delete log from the dashboard to a new tab on settings.

### Pricing and About page
From the top menu you will be able to access both Pricing and About page. We haven’t published details about the actual price yet and we would love to get your input on that. The about page tells a little about us.
