# Increasing storage at same low cost##### [Thomas Ardal](http://elmah.io/about/), February 1, 2018We are proud to be able to constantly add new features to elmah.io, without making the product more expensive. While we have kept our prices steady over the last 4 years, elmah.io changed **a lot** during that time. Once again, we are happy to announce even more free improvements for our users.As of today, we have doubled the included messages per month for the Small Business (5,000 => 10,000) and Business (25,000 => 50,000) plans. For the Business+ plan, we more than doubled the messages count (100,000 => 250,000):![More messages at same low cost](/images/more-messages-in-plans.png)We hope that the new and increased storage, will help even more users to stay on the current plan. As always, the more errors you fix, the cheaper elmah.io gets. We believe that's a good motivator for you to start looking at bugs in your applications.
