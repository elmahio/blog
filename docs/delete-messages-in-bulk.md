# Delete messages in bulk##### [Thomas Ardal](http://elmah.io/about/), January 30, 2018The most sought after feature on elmah.io has been deleting messages in bulk. Although we would've liked to offer this feature in the past, it has not been possible. So far, we have counted logged messages by looking at how many errors that are actually stored. To make sure that users were on the right plan, we haven't been able to allow delete in bulk.Since we within the next couple of months move to counting messages sent to elmah.io rather than looking at stored messages, we are happy to announce delete in bulk:![Delete messages in bulk](/images/deletebyquery.gif)
