While the elmah.io client supports modifying messages, ELMAH in its open source form doesn't.\n\n\nWith that said, there's still a way to achieve this. Let's say you want to override the user field on all errors, to a value fetched from your database. As default, ELMAH annotates all errors with the value of \nThread.CurrentPrincipal.Identity.Name\n, but that may not be what you want logged in all cases.\n\n\nTo hook into ELMAH, we'll use a hook really meant for something else: error filtering. Add a new method to \nGlobal.asax.cs\n named \nErrorLog_Filtering\n:\n\n\nvoid ErrorLog_Filtering(object sender, ExceptionFilterEventArgs args)\n{\n}\n\n\n\n\nThis method is called by ELMAH before logging all exceptions. We don't have access to the actual error object logged in this method, why we cannot just set a new username. But using a small trick, we can still achieve what we are looking to do:\n\n\nvoid ErrorLog_Filtering(object sender, ExceptionFilterEventArgs args)\n{\n    var httpContext = args.Context as HttpContext;\n    if (httpContext != null)\n    {\n        var error = new Error(args.Exception, httpContext);\n        error.User = GetUserFromDatabase();\n        ErrorLog.GetDefault(httpContext).Log(error);\n        args.Dismiss();\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\nSee what I did there? I simply create a new \nError\n object and set the \nUser\n property to the value of \nGetUserFromDatabase\n. The method is created for the example and can be anything from an in memory variable to the result of a REST request.\n\n\nWhen the new error is created, I call the \nLog\n method on ELMAH to log it to the configured store. To avoid logging two errors (the original error without the user and the new error including the user), it's important to call the \nDismiss\n-method on the original error arguments.\n\n\nThat's it! All errors are now logged with a custom value in \nUser\n. The same approach can be used for setting any variable on ELMAH's \nError\n object.",

I needed to add SSL to the URLs, but unfortunately \nGitHub Pages doesn't support HTTPS on custom domains\n (no yet at least). A popular choice for adding HTTPS, is to use the free plan on CloudFlare. It requires you to move all of your domains (subdomains + main domain) to CloudFlare, which isn't something that we want to do at this point.\n\n\nI \nasked\n my Twitter followers and got a lot of suggestions. The most simple solution was also the one I ended up using: pushing a website to Azure App Services, acting as a reverse proxy in front of GitHub Pages. A home made CloudFlare, if you will. The idea is described in great detail on the \nRuslanY Blog\n.\n\n\nTo set it up, create a new empty ASP.NET project.

As explained on the RuslanY Blog, we need to enable proxy functionality with Azure. To do so, create a new web app and upload a file named \napplicationHost.xdt\n to the \nsite\n directory:\n\n\n?xml version=\n1.0\n?\n  \n\nconfiguration xmlns:xdt=\nhttp://schemas.microsoft.com/XML-Document-Transform\n  \n\nsystem.webServer\n  \n\nproxy xdt:Transform=\nInsertIfMissing\n enabled=\ntrue\n preserveHostHeader=\nfalse\n  \nreverseRewriteHostInResponseHeaders=\nfalse\n /\n  \n\n/system.webServer\n  \n\n/configuration\n  \n\n\n\n\nThe easiest way is to use Kudo, but FTP or any Azure file browser should do the trick. That's it for the proxy part. Deploy your website to the new web app on Azure:\n\n\n\n\nI'm using the deployment feature in Visual Studio here, but you probably want to use VSTS, Octopus Deploy, Kudo or similar in production. Once deployed, Visual Studio launches your preferred browser, which now show the content from \nhttp://elmahio.github.io/blog/\n when requesting the URL \nhttp://myproxy.azurewebsites.net\n. Actually, you have SSL support already, since all websites served by \nazurewebsites.net\n comes with a SSL certificate. We need to serve the content through a custom domain, so go set that up. I won't go into detail on how to set up custom domains on Azure, since that is already described in \nhundreds of blog posts\n.\n\n\nWhen setup and the DNS records are propagated, I can browse the content on GibHub, using the Azure website as a proxy. It's important here, that you let GitHub serve the content on the default URL (\nhttp://organization.github.io/project/\n) and not on a custom domain. This means that any \nCNAME\n file you may have in your repository and/or \nCNAME\n DNS records pointing to GitHub Pages must be deleted.\n\n\nFor the final step, I need to set up HTTPS on the Azure web site.

In the case of the elmah.io blog, I've used this excellent tutorial written by Troy Hunt, to get a free SSL certificate from Let's Encrypt: \nEverything you need to know about loading a free Let's Encrypt certificate into an Azure website\n.\n\n\nI assume that you are now able to browse your GitHub Pages content through HTTPS on the custom domain. The only thing left, is to redirect requests to the non-SSL version of the domain to one including SSL.

If you want to create an integration for elmah.io, this is the package to depend.\n\n\nelmah.io.core\n\n\nThe \nelmah.io.core\n package, contains our integration for ELMAH.

No code is included in this package but in real life, you will start by installing this package anyway. The package contains config transformations, as well our PowerShell installer (the dialog you see when installing, asking for your log ID). Once installed, you can safely remove this package, leaving \nelmah.io.core\n and \nElmah.Io.Client\n as the packages handling everything.\n\n\nElmah.Io.Mvc\n\n\nWait a minute. No link? Well, we haven't created this package yet. Much like the \nelmah.io\n package, \nElmah.Io.Mvc\n will act as an easy installer when using elmah.io from ASP.NET MVC.\n\n\nElmah.Io.WebApi\n\n\nSame story as \nElmah.Io.Mvc\n.\n\n\nelmah.io.umbraco\n\n\nWe love Umbraco and believe it's the best .NET CMS out there.

As sexy as that name sounds (?), it's a good logging framework, inspired by similar community driven projects. In fact, Microsoft.Extensions.Logging can act as a simple proxy for other logging frameworks and that it exactly how you'd use it with elmah.io. Using the \nElmah.Io.Extensions.Logging\n package, you can send everything from Verbose to Fatal log statements from any .NET Core application to elmah.io.\n\n\nElmah.Io.AspNetCore\n\n\nElmah.Io.AspNetCore\n is out implementation for ASP.NET Core. Using middleware, all uncaught exceptions in your ASP.NET Core application, are send to elmah.io. If ELMAH is ever ported to ASP.NET Core, we may discontinue this package. For now, this is the package for integrating ASP.NET Core with elmah.io.\n\n\nLogary.Targets.Elmah.Io\n\n\nLogary is a logging framework for .NET, written entirely in F#. Our integration for Logary, makes it possible to log different types of messages in elmah.io, through Logary.\n\n\nelmah.io.trace\n\n\nA simple .NET trace listener, sending trace messages from the \nTrace\n class in .NET to elmah.io.\n\n\nelmah.io.nlog\n\n\nLog target for the popular .NET logging framework NLog.\n\n\nelmah.io.log4net\n\n\nAppender for the oldest .NET logging framework on the block: log4net.

To understand the rationale behind this, let's begin with a bit of history.\n\n\nWhen we initially introduced elmah.io, our customers where primarily single users, monitoring one or more logs. As a user, you would buy a subscription to use elmah.io after the trial expired. That approach actually worked for a year or two, but as our user base grew, so did the size of the companies choosing elmah.io. Being limited by the fact that only the paying user were able to create new logs, made it difficult to use elmah.io as a company with multiple employees.\n\n\nTo help fix this problem, we \nintroduced organizations\n last year. With organization support, managing logs and users, became much easier. Suddenly, every administrator in the organization, were able to create logs, manage users and more.

Even with organization support, only the paying user where able to administrate credit cards and more. Today, we are ready to change that.

            "text": "ASP.NET Core Routing Tutorial\n\n\nThomas Ardal\n, December 19, 2016\n\n\nMost parts of elmah.io consist of small services. While they may not be microservices, they are in fact small and each do one thing. We recently started experimenting with ASP.NET Core (or just Core for short) for some internal services and are planning a number of blog posts about the experiences we have made while developing these services. The previous posts are: \nAppSettings in ASP.NET Core\n, \nConfig transformations in ASP.NET Core\n, \nConfiguration with Azure App Services and ASP.NET Core\n, \nASP.NET Core Logging Tutorial\n and \nError Logging Middleware in ASP.NET Core\n.\n\n\nIn this post, we will dig into the new routing features in Core. If you have a background in ASP.NET MVC and Web API, routing shouldn't be a new concept for you. For those of you who just started doing web development in .NET, routing is responsible for mapping a request URL to a handler in the shape of a controller. When receiving a request, Core looks for a handler, able to process the incoming request based on a set of rules. In fact, routing is \"just\" a piece of middleware, that we learned about in the \nprevious post\n.\n\n\nTo create a new route, you will need to know about the \nroute template syntax\n. While a routing syntax have been available in ASP.NET MVC from the beginning, Core heavily extend the possibilities.

Notice the curly braces inside the template? Content inside a curly brace, represents a segment, which we will get back to later. Unlike previously, default values can be embedded as part of a segment, rather than through the \ndefaults\n parameter (though still supported). In the example above, requesting \n/\n would hit the \nIndex\n action of a \nHomeController\n without any \nid\n parameter or the value of that parameter set to \nnull\n.

Let's look at some of the new features added to routing in Core.\n\n\nRoute constraints, open up for much greater control of allowed values inside a route. Most of us having worked with ASP.NET MVC, have been spending hours trying to figure out why a route didn't match a controller. Route constraints is a new feature, which will put some constraints (D'oh!) on the possible values in one or more segments. Let's look at an example:\n\n\nroutes.MapRoute(\n    name: \ndefault\n,\n    template: \n{controller=Home}/{action=Index}/{id:int}\n);\n\n\n\n\nIn the example, we tell Core that the \nid\n parameter, must be of type \ninteger\n. This tell Core not to map the following request, since the last segment of the URL is a string: \nsome/url/somestring\n. You can even define ranges on integers, maxlength on strings and much more using Routing Constraints. For more information about the possibilities, check out the official \nRoute Constraint Reference\n.\n\n\nAnother new feature is the usage of wildcards. Wildcards acts as a kind of catch-all and can be used as part of any segment. Example:\n\n\nroutes.MapRoute(\n    name: \ndefault\n,\n    template: \n{controller=Home}/{action=Index}/{id:int}/{*more}\n);\n\n\n\n\nThis would map requests to both \n/some/url/42\n and \n/some/url/42/details\n. It would even map \n/some/url/42/details/show\n, since \n*\n acts as a wild card for zero or more segments.\n\n\nLike previous, route templates can be specified in attributes rather than during startup:\n\n\n[Route(\nhome/index/{id:int}/{*more}\n)]\npublic IActionResult Index(int id)\n{\n    ...\n    return View();\n}",

In this post, we will dig into the new routing features in Core. If you have a background in ASP.NET MVC and Web API, routing shouldn't be a new concept for you. For those of you who just started doing web development in .NET, routing is responsible for mapping a request URL to a handler in the shape of a controller.

Notice the curly braces inside the template? Content inside a curly brace, represents a segment, which we will get back to later. Unlike previously, default values can be embedded as part of a segment, rather than through the  defaults  parameter (though still supported). In the example above, requesting  /  would hit the  Index  action of a  HomeController  without any  id  parameter or the value of that parameter set to  null .

If you don't have the same feeling, you are either better at it than me or maybe you are doing something wrong. I've been doing professional software development for 15 years and coded before that pretty much since I got my first Commodore 64. I don't find coding that hard and with modern tools like Visual Studio and ReSharper, getting lines of code in source control is pretty much a walk in the park. Creating bug free software (doesn't exist) is freaking hard.\n\n\nIf you are already familiar with our \ntechnology stack\n and challenges in \nbuilding a scalable architecture\n, you know that elmah.io consists of many moving parts. Everything needs to work and as the system is growing, we are moving towards a microservice-based architecture, creating even more integration points that can potentially stop working. While we use different technical solutions and frameworks to support this, this post will focus on how we divide and conquer our testing activities.\n\n\nWhen developing elmah.io, we focus on three different types of tests: unit tests, integration tests and system tests. It's a pretty old school test approach, but the best we have found so far.\n\n\nUnit tests are written with \nNUnit\n, \nMoq\n and \nAutoFixture\n. There are other libraries out there, doing things a bit differently. We like the combination of these tools, since all of them are very well documented, supported by the community and integrated into Visual Studio, AppVeyor etc. We try to unit test all complex code, meaning that we in no way aim for 100 % code coverage from our unit tests. In fact we don't have a target, since we have bad experience measuring on code coverage metrics. Developers are layzy (yes we are!), why aiming for 80 % code coverage or similar, makes people (me included) write tests of lines of code rather than critical code.\n\n\nUnit tests typically looks like this:\n\n\n[TestCase(false, \n00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000\n)]\n[TestCase(false, \nhest\n)]\n[TestCase(false, null)]\n[TestCase(false, \n)]\n[TestCase(true, \n22c7a1e9-bcfc-4714-8a7a-1b241208a832\n)]\npublic void CanCheckLogId(bool shouldBeValid, string guidToCheck)\n{\n    Assert.That(guidToCheck.IsLogId(), Is.EqualTo(shouldBeValid));\n}\n\n\n\n\nFor integration tests, we use NUnit and AutoFixture as well. In integration tests, we test code like communication between microservices, queries against the database and similar. I often hear people say that one of the advantages with a microservice architecture is, that you only need to test that each service works on its own. In my experience, this approach simply doesn't guarantee that the integration between services work. With that said, having code split up into different \nbounded contexts\n and testing these separately, makes a whole lot of sense.\n\n\nIntegration tests could look like this:\n\n\n[Test]\npublic void CanGetAllLogs()\n{\n    // Arrange\n    var organisation = CreateOrganisation(userId);\n    var log1 = CreateLog(fixture.Create\nstring\n(), organisation.Id);\n    var log2 = CreateLog(fixture.Create\nstring\n(), organisation.Id);\n    this.CreateUser(userId, log1.Id, log2.Id);\n    elasticClient.Flush(f =\n f.Index(index));\n\n    // Act\n    var logs = elmahLogsController.All();\n\n    // Assert\n    Assert.That(logs.Logs.Count(), Is.EqualTo(2));\n    Assert.That(logs.Organisations.Count, Is.EqualTo(1));\n    Assert.That(logs.Organisations.First().Logs.Count, Is.EqualTo(2));\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nSystem tests involves spinning up the entire system and clicking buttons inside the UI or calling endpoints in the API. These are by far the most expensive tests to run and we try not to test everything through the UI each time we change something. We use mindmaps to help identify all of the features we have and what should be tested:\n\n\n\n\nThis is an actual photo of a mindmap hanging at my desk as of writing this post. We have found that splitting features into branches on a mindmap, helps us identifying which areas of the software that we should test. Change something in the user profile =\n go to the Profile branch and assess which flows to test.\n\n\nPeople sometimes ask us, if we have automated UI tests. When we tell them that we don't, the next question is always \"why not?\". I have seen automated UI tests providing value, but maintaining the tests have always required a full time position for at least one guy (or gal). I believe that I have some experience in this area. Throughout the years, I have worked with a lot of frameworks, promising smooth development of UI tests like Silk test, Selenium, NBehave, SpecFlow, Ranorex and more. They are all good tools, but require a massive effort to keep running. Since we are a small startup, we have decided to perform system tests manually for now, but things could definitely change in the future.\n\n\nBesides that time saved executing manual tests, another advantage of automated UI tests, would be the option of testing more browsers, versions and operating systems (using something like \nSelenium grid\n).

While they may not be microservices, they are in fact small and each do one thing. We recently started experimenting with ASP.NET Core (or just Core for short) for some internal services and are planning a number of blog posts about the experiences we have made while developing these services. This is the fifth part in the series. The previous posts are: \nAppSettings in ASP.NET Core\n, \nConfig transformations in ASP.NET Core\n, \nConfiguration with Azure App Services and ASP.NET Core\n and \nASP.NET Core Logging Tutorial\n.\n\n\nThis post is about the concept of middleware in Core. We have named the post \nError Logging Middleware in ASP.NET Core\n, because we want to use error logging as an example of utilizing middleware. The concepts around middleware shown in the examples throughout this post isn't bound to error logging in any way and can be used as a foundation for building all types of middleware.\n\n\nMiddleware are code components executed as part of the request pipeline in Core. If you have a background in ASP.NET and think this sounds familiar, you're right. Middleware is pretty much HTTP modules as you know it from ASP.NET. The biggest difference between modules and middleware is really how you configure it. Modules are configured in \nweb.config\n and since Core doesn't use the concept of a \nweb.config\n, you configure middleware in C#. If you know Express for Node.js, you will find that configuring middleware heavily borrow a lot of concepts from that.\n\n\nLet's wait with more babbling about middleware and look at an example. Middleware in its most simple form, is a C# class. Let's create some error logging middleware:\n\n\npublic class ErrorLoggingMiddleware\n{\n    private readonly RequestDelegate _next;\n\n    public ErrorLoggingMiddleware(RequestDelegate next)\n    {\n        _next = next;\n    }\n\n    public async Task Invoke(HttpContext context)\n    {\n        try\n        {\n            await _next(context);\n        }\n        catch (Exception e)\n        {\n            System.Diagnostics.Debug.WriteLine($\nThe following error happened: {e.Message}\n);\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\nIn order for our middleware to work, we need to implement two things. A constructor accepting a \nRequestDelegate\n and an \nInvoke\n method. The contructor is called a single time, but the underlying delegate will change from request to request. All middleware components are responsible for either executing the next link in the pipeline (\n_next\n) or terminate the pipeline by not calling \n_next\n. In our case, we want to execute the rest of the pipeline in order to catch any exceptions happening while processing the HTTP request. When an exception is catched, we log a message to \nSystem.Diagnostics.Debug\n. In real life you probably want to log somewhere better, but for the demo, we want the exception to show up inside Visual Studio only.\n\n\nTo tell Core about our new and shiny piece of middleware, configure it in \nStartup.cs\n:\n\n\npublic void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IHostingEnvironment env, ILoggerFactory fac)\n{\n    ...\n    app.UseMiddleware\nErrorLoggingMiddleware\n();\n    ...\n}\n\n\n\n\nTo test the middleware, make the \nIndex\n-method in \nHomeController\n throw an exception:\n\n\npublic class HomeController : Controller\n{\n    public IActionResult Index()\n    {\n        throw new Exception(\nSome error yo\n);\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\nWhen starting the project, the exception is now logged to the Output window in Visual Studio:\n\n\n\n\nSuccess! We just implemented our first piece of functional middleware for Core.\n\n\nWhile calling the \nUseMiddleware\n method in \nStartup.cs\n definitely work, it is considered good practice to create a custom \nUse\n-method:\n\n\npublic static class ErrorLoggingMiddlewareExtensions\n{\n    public static IApplicationBuilder UseErrorLogging(this IApplicationBuilder builder)\n    {\n        return builder.UseMiddleware\nErrorLoggingMiddleware\n();\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\nCall the static method in \nStartup.cs\n:\n\n\npublic void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IHostingEnvironment env, ILoggerFactory fac)\n{\n    ...\n    app.UseErrorLogging();\n    ...\n}\n\n\n\n\nFor an example on how to implement fully featured error logging middleware for Core, check out our \nelmah.io support for ASP.NET Core\n on \nGitHub\n.\n\n\nIn the next post, we will take a look at \nrouting in ASP.NET Core\n.",

This post is about the concept of middleware in Core. We have named the post  Error Logging Middleware in ASP.NET Core , because we want to use error logging as an example of utilizing middleware. The concepts around middleware shown in the examples throughout this post isn't bound to error logging in any way and can be used as a foundation for building all types of middleware.  Middleware are code components executed as part of the request pipeline in Core. If you have a background in ASP.NET and think this sounds familiar, you're right. Middleware is pretty much HTTP modules as you know it from ASP.NET. The biggest difference between modules and middleware is really how you configure it. Modules are configured in  web.config  and since Core doesn't use the concept of a  web.config , you configure middleware in C#. If you know Express for Node.js, you will find that configuring middleware heavily borrow a lot of concepts from that.  Let's wait with more babbling about middleware and look at an example.

While they may not be microservices, they are in fact small and each do one thing. We recently started experimenting with ASP.NET Core (or just Core for short) for some internal services and we already released a number of blog posts about the subject. This post is meant to summarize on all of our material on ASP.NET Core.\n\n\nWhat is ASP.NET Core\n\n\nASP.NET Core is an open source redesign of ASP.NET, able to run on multiple operating systems like Linux, Mac and Windows. Core lives alongside the existing ASP.NET and doesn't deprecate anything that you know (so far at least). Core runs on top of both .NET core as well as the full .NET framework. Since only .NET core runs on Mac and Linux, choosing to run Core on the full .NET framework, also binds you to run it on Windows (which may be a fine decision in many case).\n\n\nCore contains a lot of the same features as available in ASP.NET (MVC, Web API etc.). With that said, you will find that developing applications in Core, is quite another experience. While Core definitely offer some nice features, ASP.NET still is the more mature platform. In time, Core may or may not replace ASP.NET entirely, but only time will tell.\n\n\nConcepts in Core\n\n\nCore offers a range of new concepts. While some are born out of OWIN and inspiration from Node.js, others are entirely new. Here are a list of terms to know about in Core:\n\n\nInitialization\n\n\nWeb applications are no longer configured through \nGlobal.asax\n and \nweb.config\n.. There's a new class in town, simply called \nStartup.cs\n to configure everything around Core.\n\n\nConfiguration\n\n\nA new configuration system has been developed for Core. To read more, check out our blog posts about configuration:\n\n\n\n\nAppSettings in ASP.NET Core\n\n\nConfig transformations in ASP.NET Core\n\n\nConfiguration with Azure App Services and ASP.NET Core\n\n\n\n\nMiddleware\n\n\nMuch like OWIN and Node.js, Core uses the concept of middleware. Middleware are code components executed as part of the application pipeline. You will find middleware for a lot of different purposes like logging, exception handling, routing etc.\n\n\nWe wrote a blog post about middleware as well:\n\n\n\n\nError Logging Middleware in ASP.NET Core\n\n\n\n\nLogging\n\n\nCore comes with a new logging framework called Microsoft.Extensions.Logging. If you want to know more about logging, read through our blog post:\n\n\n\n\nASP.NET Core Logging Tutorial\n\n\n\n\nRouting\n\n\nRouting in its basic form, works much like in previous versions of ASP.NET. When looking into the details, you quickly spot some new features and fixes, that makes routing in Core really awesome. We blogged about routing here:\n\n\n\n\nASP.NET Core Routing Tutorial\n\n\n\n\nError Handling\n\n\nError handling in Core is something that we are particular interested in :-) Stay tuned for future blog posts about the subject and make sure to check out our \nelmah.io middleware for ASP.NET Core\n.\n\n\nDependency Injection\n\n\nDependency injection always were a bit of a hack in ASP.NET. Since Core has been designed from the ground up, dependency injection is provided out of the box. The DI framework in Core doesn't necessarily replace your favourite IoC container, since it plays well with popular packages like Autofac and Windsor.\n\n\nKestrel\n\n\nKestrel is a new webserver bundled with Core. Kestrel is a lightweight web server, built on top of libuv (yes, the same as Node.js). Kestrel is used to serve requests in Core, but it isn't intended to be serving requests towards the public. For that purpose, integrations for other web servers and reverse proxies have been made available from Microsoft. A popular choice for now, is to wrap Kestrel behind IIS, but serving Core behind Apache or nginx, seems like obvious choices as well.",

This is the fourth part in the series. The previous posts are: \nAppSettings in ASP.NET Core\n, \nConfig transformations in ASP.NET Core\n and \nConfiguration with Azure App Services and ASP.NET Core\n.\n\n\nIn the previous posts, the focus was on configuration. In this post, we will take a look at the new logging features in Core. Where previous versions of ASP.NET had hooks to capture information about exceptions and similar, ASP.NET Core comes with its own logging framework called \nMicrosoft.Extensions.Logging\n. Microsoft.Extensions.Logging is available on NuGet and isn't bound to ASP.NET Core in any way. This mean that you will be able to utilize this new logging framework from Microsoft throughout all of your applications and services. Logging is based on providers which works as appenders in log4net and sinks in Serilog. A range of providers are available on NuGet for existing logging frameworks like NLog, Serilog and elmah.io. In other words, you don't need to switch to another logging framework, since you can always configure a provider for a logging framework of choice.\n\n\nLet's learn about Microsoft.Extensions.Logging from an example. Create a new ASP.NET Core project through Visual Studio or the command line. In my case, I'm using Visual Studio 2017 RC, but the generated code looks similar when generated from VS2015 or the CLI. When generated, open the \nStartup.cs\n file and navigate to the \nConfigure\n method:\n\n\n// This method gets called by the runtime. Use this method to configure the HTTP request pipeline.\npublic void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IHostingEnvironment env, ILoggerFactory loggerFactory)\n{\n    loggerFactory.AddConsole(Configuration.GetSection(\nLogging\n));\n    loggerFactory.AddDebug();\n\n    ...\n}\n\n\n\n\nAs stated in the comment in the top, the \nConfigure\n method is called when starting the website. See the \nILoggerFactory\n parameter sent to the method? That's our main entry point for configuring logging. \nILoggerFactory\n provides a fluent API for setting up our logging needs. To do some logging, we need an instance of another interface called \nILogger\n, but let's with that for a minute. While you can create an instance of \nILoggerFactory\n yourself, using the instance provided by Core, ensures that you capture log events from Kestrel and other components already initialized at this point.\n\n\nThe code is pretty much self-documented. We tell Microsoft.Extensions.Logging to log messages to the console and debug (through \nSystem.Diagnostics.Debug.WriteLine\n). In a future post, I'll show you how to configure different aspects of logging. For now, the only thing I'll mention is log levels. Like Serilog, NLog etc., Microsoft.Extensions.Logging implements a range of different log levels from Trace to Critical. As default, most providers only logs from Information and up. If you want to extend this to also log Trace and Debug messages, you can configure this as part of adding each provider:\n\n\nloggerFactory.AddDebug(LogLevel.Trace);\n\n\n\n\nThe console provider configured as part of the generated code, uses the \nappsettings.json\n file as explained in the previous three posts. To change the minimum log level for this provider, either configure the provider all through C# code or change the \nLogging.LogLevel.Default\n setting in \nappsettings.json\n:\n\n\n{\n  \nLogging\n: {\n    \nIncludeScopes\n: false,\n    \nLogLevel\n: {\n      \nDefault\n: \nTrace\n,\n      \nSystem\n: \nInformation\n,\n      \nMicrosoft\n: \nInformation\n\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\nUntil now, we haven't logged anything. To do so, use dependency injection in Core to inject an instance of \nILoggerFactory\n in your controller:\n\n\npublic class HomeController : Controller\n{\n    ILoggerFactory _loggerFactory;\n\n    public HomeController(ILoggerFactory loggerFactory)\n    {\n        _loggerFactory = loggerFactory;\n    }\n\n    public IActionResult Index()\n    {\n        var logger = _loggerFactory.CreateLogger(\nMyLogger\n);\n        logger.LogInformation(\nCalling the Index action\n);\n        return View();\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\nI've injected \nILoggerFactory\n into the \nHomeController\n. To start logging, call the \nCreateLogger\n method to get an instance of \nILogger\n. As previously mentioned, \nILogger\n is the client used to log messages to the configured providers. In this example, we log an information message. The \nMyLogger\n string sent to the \nCreateLogger\n method, tells Microsoft.Extensions.Logging that all messages logged to this logger, will be in the \nMyLogger\n category. Categories is something that I want to elaborate on in a future post.\n\n\nInstead of creating a new logger every time, we can simply inject an instance of \nILogger\n instead:\n\n\npublic class HomeController : Controller\n{\n    ILogger\nHomeController\n _logger;\n\n    public HomeController(ILogger\nHomeController\n logger)\n    {\n        _logger = logger;\n    }\n\n    public IActionResult Index()\n    {\n        _logger.LogInformation(\nCalling the Index action\n);\n        return View();\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\nDecorating the \nILogger\n with a generic parameter of \nHomeController\n, automatically generates a logger with a category of the \nHomeController\n.\n\n\nIn the next post, I'll show you how to implement custom \nError Logging Middleware in ASP.NET Core\n.

To do so, use dependency injection in Core to inject an instance of  ILoggerFactory  in your controller:  public class HomeController : Controller\n{\n    ILoggerFactory _loggerFactory;\n\n    public HomeController(ILoggerFactory loggerFactory)\n    {\n        _loggerFactory = loggerFactory;\n    }\n\n    public IActionResult Index()\n    {\n        var logger = _loggerFactory.CreateLogger( MyLogger );\n        logger.LogInformation( Calling the Index action );\n        return View();\n    }\n}  I've injected  ILoggerFactory  into the  HomeController . To start logging, call the  CreateLogger  method to get an instance of  ILogger . As previously mentioned,  ILogger  is the client used to log messages to the configured providers. In this example, we log an information message. The  MyLogger  string sent to the  CreateLogger  method, tells Microsoft.Extensions.Logging that all messages logged to this logger, will be in the  MyLogger  category. Categories is something that I want to elaborate on in a future post.  Instead of creating a new logger every time, we can simply inject an instance of  ILogger  instead:  public class HomeController : Controller\n{\n    ILogger HomeController  _logger;\n\n    public HomeController(ILogger HomeController  logger)\n    {\n        _logger = logger;\n    }\n\n    public IActionResult Index()\n    {\n        _logger.LogInformation( Calling the Index action );\n        return View();\n    }\n}  Decorating the  ILogger  with a generic parameter of  HomeController , automatically generates a logger with a category of the  HomeController .  In the next post, I'll show you how to implement custom  Error Logging Middleware in ASP.NET Core . Also make sure to visit our post  Best practices logging in Web API and MVC with C#",

To tell Core about this configuration file, a couple of lines have been added to the \nStartup.cs\n file when generating the project:\n\n\nvar builder = new ConfigurationBuilder()\n    .SetBasePath(env.ContentRootPath)\n    .AddJsonFile(\nappsettings.json\n, optional: true, reloadOnChange: true)\n    .AddJsonFile($\nappsettings.{env.EnvironmentName}.json\n, optional: true)\n    .AddEnvironmentVariables();\nConfiguration = builder.Build();\n\n\n\n\nNotice how the \nappsettings.json\n file is added to the \nConfigurationBuilder\n. Also pay attention the line following that, adding another JSON file named \nappsettings.{env.EnvironmentName}.json\n. We will get back to this file in the next post.\n\n\nTo add application settings to the application, open \nappsettings.json\n and add the following lines before the \nLogging\n part already there:\n\n\nAppSettings\n:{\n    \nHello\n: \nWorld\n\n},\n\nLogg...\n\n\n\n\nUnlike settings in \nweb.config\n, configuration in \nappsettings.json\n can be hierarchical. We use this to define a new section called \nAppSettings\n with a key called \nHello\n. Both \nAppSettings\n and \nHello\n could have been named anything we'd like.\n\n\nCore uses an options pattern to resolve settings from \nappsettings.json\n. To read the \nHello\n setting from the configuration file, add the following line to the \nConfigureServices\n-method in \nStartup.cs\n:\n\n\nvar appSettings = Configuration.GetSection(\nAppSettings\n);\n\n\n\n\nThis tells Core to read the \nAppSettings\n object from \nappsettings.json\n. Core is heavily based on dependency injection, why you no longer want to call \nConfigurationManager\n from within your code. Instead you inject various options in your controllers. To register \nAppSettings\n in the container, create a new C# class representing the settings:\n\n\npublic class AppSettings\n{\n    public string Hello { get; set; }\n}\n\n\n\n\nThen register the settings in the container by adding the following line to \nStartup.cs\n (just after the call to \nGetSection\n):\n\n\nservices.Configure\nAppSettings\n(appSettings);\n\n\n\n\nThis tells the Core container to register the class of type \nAppSettings\n with the configuration section resolved from \nappsettings.json\n.\n\n\nNow that we have settings in the container, injecting them into a controller is easy using the options pattern. Add a constructor to the HomeController looking like this:\n\n\nprivate readonly AppSettings _appSettings;\n\npublic HomeController(IOptions\nAppSettings\n appSettings)\n{\n    _appSettings = appSettings.Value;\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nWe inject an instance of \nIOptions\n with a generic type of \nAppSettings\n, which we just saw in \nStartup.cs\n.

This is the first part in the series about the configuration system available in Core.  Core doesn't have the concept of  appSettings ,  connectionStrings  and other known features from ASP.NET. In fact configuration isn't even located in web.config.

The UI available for message grouping haven't been as crisp as the rest of the experience though. Take a look at how message groping looked like until recently:\n\n\n\n\nIn the example, I've grouped my warnings by URL which would still cause a long list of rows with nothing more than a headline added above all similar rows.\n\n\nBut we can do so much better and that's exactly what we've done. Take a look at the new messages grouping feature recently released:\n\n\n\n\nMessages are now properly grouped in the UI as well, showing all similar messages within the same control. The counter located in the upper left corner shows which instance of the message you are currently looking at (within the expanded group). The navigation icons located in the upper right, makes it possible to navigate between instances to see differences like when the message where logged etc. The collapsed group located in the bottom of the screen, show a counter indicating how many messages that are in the group.\n\n\nIt's important for me to underline, that every single message is still saved as its own unit.

We are getting ready to implement a better grouping algorithm, making it possible to create smart groups by looking at similar messages, rather than grouping on a single and exact value.

If not, take a look at \nAdding Version Information\n. Having a version number on all errors, is extremely useful for tracking bad releases. In this post, I'll explain different approaches for automatically decorating your errors with the version number of your software.\n\n\nTo make it easy to change and read, we'll add the version number in a new app setting named \nVersion\n. This could might as well have been a version.txt file in App_Data, an updated AssemblyInfo.cs file before build or whatever approach you use to stamp your releases with versions.\n\n\nThe version settings in our example looks like this:\n\n\nappSettings\n\n  \nadd key=\nVersion\n value=\n1.7.0.3\n /\n\n\n/appSettings\n\n\n\n\n\nA simple key value pair telling the system that the current software is part of the \n1.7.0.3\n release. To decorate every message logged to elmah.io with this version, add the following lines during your initialization code (like Global.asax.cs, Startup.cs or similar):\n\n\nElmah.ErrorLog.GetDefault(null); // Forces creation of logger client\nvar logger = ErrorLog.Client;\nif (logger != null)\n{\n    logger.OnMessage += (sender, args) =\n\n    {\n        if (args.Message == null) return;\n        args.Message.Version = ConfigurationManager.AppSettings[\nVersion\n];\n    };\n}\n\n\n\n\nUsing the \nOnMessage\n event on the elmah.io.client, we get a chance to intercept and change all messages being send off to the elmah.io API. In the code above, the \nVersion\n property is set to the value of the app settings specified in web.config. In fact this approach is not specific to Azure at all and is considered the preferred way of decorating messages with a version number.\n\n\nAs for Azure, pretty much the same rules apply, since Azure websites are simply plain old ASP.NET (MVC/Web API) apps. Whether or not you use VSTS, TeamCity, Octopus or similar to build the version number, setting that app setting is straight forward. But what about git deployments using the Kudu engine? With this approach, every push to a git repository of your choice, is automatically build end deployed to Azure. Using this popular approach, you are pretty much stuck with setting version numbers manually and checking it into Git. Unfortunately, Kudo doesn't provide any information about the current deployment through environment variables or similar.\n\n\nUsing the \nPost Deployment Action Hooks\n in Kudo, we are able to hook custom code into the deployment process, setting the version number. Deployment hooks are basically scripts/executables that runs after the deployment has completed successfully. To set a version number after a deployment, we can do a bit of web.config transformation magic and combining it with PowerShell. First, update your Web.Release.Config:\n\n\nadd key=\nVersion\n value=\n$version\n xdt:Transform=\nSetAttributes\n xdt:Locator=\nMatch(key)\n /\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen running a release build, the \nVersion\n setting is updated with the value of \n$version\n. Then create a new PowerShell script:\n\n\n$version = Get-Date -format u\n(Get-Content ..\\wwwroot\\web.config).replace('$version', $version) | Set-Content ..\\wwwroot\\web.config\n\n\n\n\nThe script calculates a version number from the current date and time and update the \n$version\n string inside the config file.\n\n\nFinally, you need to upload your PowerShell file. The easiest approach is to navigate to your Kudo UI (located on \nhttps://yoursite.scm.azurewebsites.net\n). Go to the Debug console and navigate to \nsite\\deployments\\tools\\PostDeploymentActions\n (create it if it doesn't exist).\n\n\nTo create the new PowerShell file, write the following in the prompt:\n\n\ntouch update-version-number.ps1\n\n\n\n\nEdit the new file and paste the PowerShell from the previous step. That's it! Your \nupdate-version-number.ps1\n script now runs as part of every deploy, updating the version app setting with the current date and time.",

            "text": "Writing custom error loggers for ELMAH\n\n\nThomas Ardal\n, September 6, 2016\n\n\nSomething struck me the other day while reading a question on StackOverflow. No really good documentation on creating custom error log implementations is available anywhere. One could argue that the process is easy and while the interface is definitely easy to implement, there are still a couple of nice things to know. This post summarises our experiences while implementing the ELMAH logger for elmah.io.\n\n\nCreating the project\n\n\nYou probably want your ELMAH logger in a separate project. Create a new Class Library through Visual Studio. In order to use the classes provided by ELMAH, you will need to install the NuGet package:\n\n\nInstall-Package elmah.corelibrary\n\n\n\n\nNotice that I'm installing \nelmah.corelibrary\n and not \nELMAH\n. The ELMAH package contains additional web.config transformations, which we don't need in our custom logger.\n\n\nThe \nErrorLog\n class\n\n\nThis first thing you need to do when implementing a log target for ELMAH, is to extend the \nErrorLog\n class. \nErrorLog\n is ELMAH's main entry point for both logging new errors as well as providing data for \nelmah.axd\n (ELMAH's native UI).\n\n\nLet's create an empty error logger:\n\n\npublic class MyErrorLog : Elmah.ErrorLog\n{\n    public override string Log(Error error)\n    {\n        throw new System.NotImplementedException();\n    }\n\n    public override ErrorLogEntry GetError(string id)\n    {\n        throw new System.NotImplementedException();\n    }\n\n    public override int GetErrors(int pageIndex, int pageSize, IList errorEntryList)\n    {\n        throw new System.NotImplementedException();\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\nImplementing the methods \nLog\n, \nGetError\n and \nGetErrors\n is everything needed in order to start using the custom logger.\n\n\nstring Log(Error error)\n\n\nThe \nLog\n method is called by ELMAH when an unhandled error occur on your website. The method takes a parameter of type \nError\n which contain all of the contextual information around the thrown error like the exception, the server variables and the source of the error.\n\n\nDepending on where you need to store your errors, you will need to implement storing logic inside this method. Notice how the method returns a \nstring\n? That's for the id of the data you generate and can be any string. For example, if you store the error in a database, the id will be the primary key of the new entity.\n\n\nErrorLogEntry GetError(string id)\n\n\nThe \nGetError\n method is for fetching detailed information about a single error. This method is called when clicking on an error in \nelmah.axd\n to show all of the details about the error. \nid\n corresponds to the id that you returned from the \nLog\n method.\n\n\nTo return the details, again this is where to write your custom logic. If you fetch the error from a database, creating a query or similar depending on the technology goes into this method. You will need to return the information as an instance of \nErrorLogEntry\n. An \nErrorLogEntry\n is a contextual class, holding information about the thrown error as well information about the error log containing this error.\n\n\nYou would normally create the \nErrorLogEntry\n like this:\n\n\nvar errorLogEntry = new ErrorLogEntry(this, id, error);\n\n\n\n\nThe \nthis\n parameter is the reference to the current error logger itself. The \nid\n parameter is the id send by ELMAH to the \nGetError\n method. The last parameter contains the actual error information embedded in an \nError\n class. Sounds familiar? That's because we already saw that class in the \nLog\n method. Where you would need to map \nError\n to your persistence layer in the \nLog\n method, here you will need to reverse that process by retrieving the error from your storage layer and map it into an \nError\n.\n\n\nint GetErrors(int pageIndex, int pageSize, IList errorEntryList)\n\n\nThe final method \nGetErrors\n will return a range of errors. This method is used to generate the list of errors shown on the frontpage of \nelmah.axd\n. The method takes a \npageIndex\n and \npageSize\n parameter to allow for pagination of the data. Since \nelmah.axd\n provides this feature, you will need to implement paging against your persistence layer. The \npageIndex\n represents the page number currently visible (0, 1, 2 etc.). The \npageSize\n represents the amount of errors that ELMAH want to fetch. The UI contains a range of options from 10 to 100. In other words, your code should be optimized enough to be able to query, fetch and map up till 100 errors from your persistence layer.\n\n\nIf you look at the method signature once more, you wont actually return the mapped errors as the return type of the method. The \nint\n returned from the method should be the total number of errors in the database. The actual error data goes into the \nerrorEntryList\n. The content of \nerrorEntryList\n should be zero or more object of type \nErrorLogEntry\n. That's right, the same class as returned by \nGetError\n.\n\n\nThat's it. When all three methods are implemented, you now have a custom error logger for ELMAH. Congrats!\n\n\nConfiguration\n\n\nChanges are that you need some configuration variables like a connection string inside your custom logger. While you can fetch app settings or similar inside the error logger, following the principles of other ELMAH loggers is considered good style. Take a look at error logger for XML files:\n\n\nerrorLog type=\nElmah.XmlFileErrorLog, Elmah\n logPath=\n~/App_Data\n /\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \nlogPath\n attribute tells the \nXmlFileErrorLog\n where to store the XML files generated by that error logger. So how to implement this? Say hello to \nIDictionary\n. That's right, a plain old dictionary from the times before LINQ. To allow for attributes like this, add a constructor to your error logger:\n\n\npublic MyErrorLog(IDictionary config)\n{\n    if (config == null)\n    {\n        throw new ArgumentNullException(\nconfig\n);\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\nELMAH automatically maps all attributes besides the \ntype\n attribute specified on the \nerrorLog\n element to this dictionary. Looking up an attribute is as simple as this: \nconfig[\"myAttribute\"]\n.\n\n\nGood to know\n\n\nWhile we've been around most issues around implementing a custom error logger already, there are still a couple of things nice to know.\n\n\nFirst of all, ELMAH creates a new instance of your error logger for each uncaught error. This means that you will need to think about the lifestyle of each connection you create for your error logger. If you need something to be singleton, you don't want to create it in the constructor of the error log. Alternatively you specify a singleton property on your log.\n\n\nELMAH allow for an application name to be specified as an attribute on the \nerrorLog\n element named \napplicationName\n. The value of this attribute is not mapped automatically by ELMAH and must be handled by your code. In most cases, you will only need to add the following code to the constructor of your error logger:\n\n\nApplicationName = config.Contains(\napplicationName\n) ? config[\napplicationName\n].ToString() : string.Empty;\n\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\n\nImplementing a custom error logger for ELMAH is actually pretty easy. If you are thinking that the API smells a bit like the millennium, remember that ELMAH is more than 10 years old. Still, it is the most commonly used error management solution for .NET web applications with good reason.\n\n\nRemember to publish your custom error loggers to NuGet and let the community know about it through the various options on \nGoogle Groups\n.",

Looking up an attribute is as simple as this:  config[\"myAttribute\"] .",

            "text": "While we've been around most issues around implementing a custom error logger already, there are still a couple of things nice to know.  First of all, ELMAH creates a new instance of your error logger for each uncaught error. This means that you will need to think about the lifestyle of each connection you create for your error logger. If you need something to be singleton, you don't want to create it in the constructor of the error log. Alternatively you specify a singleton property on your log.  ELMAH allow for an application name to be specified as an attribute on the  errorLog  element named  applicationName . The value of this attribute is not mapped automatically by ELMAH and must be handled by your code. In most cases, you will only need to add the following code to the constructor of your error logger:  ApplicationName = config.Contains( applicationName ) ? config[ applicationName ].ToString() : string.Empty;",

Remember to publish your custom error loggers to NuGet and let the community know about it through the various options on  Google Groups .",

            "text": ".NET Logging Tools and Libraries\n\n\nThomas Ardal\n, June 10, 2016\n\n\nIt's a jungle out there, as they say. The community around .NET logging tools and frameworks is growing every day and multiple options covering the same basic needs exists. This definitive guide will help you through the large offer of frameworks and make it possible for you to choose the right logging strategy.\n\n\nWhat's Logging?\n\n\nBefore we dig into the large number of logging frameworks, let's spend a bit of time discussing the terms related to logging. Logging as a single term, means storing messages from your application somewhere. These messages are often used for debugging errors, but I've seen log data used for multiple other purposes like creating a dashboard, monitoring updates, audit trails etc. The nice thing about logging is, that you're in control if a message should go into the log or not.\n\n\nAs mentioned, most people use logging frameworks for logging exceptions and other messages making it possible to debug errors in production. All of the frameworks mentioned in this post support error logging, while few actually build error management features on top of the log. Error management actually helps you monitor and deal with your errors in a more intelligent way than having to look through log files. More on that subject later.\n\n\nLogging Frameworks\n\n\nWe've compiled a list of logging frameworks for .NET. There's a great deal of options out there, but a lot of them are no longer maintained. The list provided in this section contains the popular choices.\n\n\nlog4net\n\n\nProbably the oldest logging framework on the block, \nlog4net\n have existed pretty much since .NET was introduced. log4net was originally an internal Apache log4j port developed by Neoworks Limited back in 2001. The project quickly moved to Sourceforge (the GitHub of 2001) and was released under the Apache license. Since that time, log4net has been one of the most popular choices in the .NET world for adding logging to applications.\n\n\nlog4net works with the concept of appenders, where log messages can be routed to different data stores. A lot of appenders have been implemented during the years, like logging to the file system, SQL Server, HTTP endpoints and even NoSQL databases. Being unstructured text messages, log4net and NoSQL don\u2019t exactly go hand in hand.\n\n\nELMAH\n\n\nBack in 2004, Atif Aziz spotted something important. Websites sometimes fails without we as web developers actually spotting the errors. That's why he decided to create \nELMAH\n. While ELMAH can be used as a logging framework, the focus is entirely upon errors. While we still see people misusing ELMAH to log debug messages, ELMAH is after 12 years still the best choice of logging uncaught errors in your websites.\n\n\nNLog\n\n\nWhile log4net quickly became the default choice, alternatives began to show up. Probably the first real competitor to log4net's dominance were \nNLog\n. Originally developed by Jarek Kowalski and with pull requests from almost 100 people, NLog is a great alternative. While log4net pretty much stood still from 2006, NLog just kept going. While Jarek seemed to pull the plug when starting at Google, the community seemed to step up and new releases are still flowing.\n\n\nLike log4net, NLog contains multiple log targets, and is able to log messages to various data stores.\n\n\nSerilog\n\n\nIn 2013, the .NET logging framework were taken by storm once again. When everyone else were logging text messages, Micholas Blumhardt did something new: structured logging. Unlike existing logging frameworks, \nSerilog\n introduced .NET developers to structured event data rather than dumb text messages. Serilog quickly became one of the fastest moving projects in the .NET community and still is. We really recommend you to look into Serilog for logging messages from your .NET apps.\n\n\nError Management\n\n\nWe wanted to put some words on the terms Error Management. We often talk to people that don't realize, that there's a big difference between Error Logging and Error Management. While log4net, NLog and Serilog are great choices for logging text-based or structured log messages to a text file or a database, this is simply not enough to monitor your websites and act on errors. Having a log file is one thing. Even with cool storage choices like Seq and Elasticsearch, having a system for monitoring and handling errors is an essential part of web application development today.\n\n\nA lot of choices showed up during the last few years. \nelmah.io\n, New Relic, Raygun and Stackify are all examples of popular choices for implementing error management. All run in the Cloud and provides easy integration with your .NET websites. When looking through the different solutions, some basic features work pretty much the same way, while others vary by product. Some focus on supporting a lot of different programming languages, others on integrating with logging frameworks and some on integrating with third party systems like Slack and GitHub.\n\n\nAt \nelmah.io\n, we are working hard to create the best error management system for .NET web applications. We support all the major logging frameworks and tools for .NET like ELMAH, log4net, NLog and Serilog. We also provide some unique features for .NET developers like Visual Studio integration and one-click installation through NuGet. We definitely want you to try out elmah.io for your error management needs in .NET.",

The project quickly moved to Sourceforge (the GitHub of 2001) and was released under the Apache license. Since that time, log4net has been one of the most popular choices in the .NET world for adding logging to applications.  log4net works with the concept of appenders, where log messages can be routed to different data stores. A lot of appenders have been implemented during the years, like logging to the file system, SQL Server, HTTP endpoints and even NoSQL databases. Being unstructured text messages, log4net and NoSQL don\u2019t exactly go hand in hand.",

While log4net, NLog and Serilog are great choices for logging text-based or structured log messages to a text file or a database, this is simply not enough to monitor your websites and act on errors. Having a log file is one thing. Even with cool storage choices like Seq and Elasticsearch, having a system for monitoring and handling errors is an essential part of web application development today.  A lot of choices showed up during the last few years.  elmah.io , New Relic, Raygun and Stackify are all examples of popular choices for implementing error management. All run in the Cloud and provides easy integration with your .NET websites. When looking through the different solutions, some basic features work pretty much the same way, while others vary by product. Some focus on supporting a lot of different programming languages, others on integrating with logging frameworks and some on integrating with third party systems like Slack and GitHub.  At  elmah.io , we are working hard to create the best error management system for .NET web applications. We support all the major logging frameworks and tools for .NET like ELMAH, log4net, NLog and Serilog.

Today we wanted to end this series with a big bang.  One of the nice features in ELMAH is also one of the more dangerous. As default, access to your ELMAH logs (/elmah.axd) is available from localhost only. But using a small config change, you can actually browse your errors logs on a deployed website. Troy Hunt already  proved why open ELMAH logs are very dangerous  and can be easily exploited by hackers. To help you secure your ELMAH logs, we introduce the ELMAH Security Validator.  The ELMAH Security Validator lets you input your URL and seconds later you will be presented with the result of the scan:   The tool is available at  https://elmah.io/tools/validator .  We'll do a follow up on all of the improvements next week. So for now, have a great weekend.",

This post is a thorough walkthrough of the technologies in play in order to keep the elmah.io engine running.\n\n\nWindows Azure\n\n\nelmah.io runs entirely on Windows Azure. We use a combination of web apps, virtual machines, service bus and storage to host everything in the cloud.\n\n\nASP.NET MVC\n\n\nelmah.io is pretty much a single page application. All of the static HTML seen in the UI is served by ASP.NET MVC. We actually started out with simple HTML files, but quickly found out that MVC offers so much more than Razor (which we don't use).\n\n\nASP.NET Web API\n\n\nBoth our internal API for feeding the UI, as well as our public API are hosted by ASP.NET Web API. Web API may not be the coolest kid on the block, but it works great and actually got some nice features from v2.\n\n\nElasticsearch\n\n\nIf you ever wondered how elmah.io is able to provide instant search results when executing full text queries from the UI, Elasticsearch is the answer. This perfect NoSQL database is the foundation for most of the data access on elmah.io.\n\n\nRedis\n\n\nEveryone needs caching in order to provide a responsive product. Redis has turned out as the perfect choice for not only cache DB data, but also persist temporary statistics about which mails have been send etc.\n\n\nVisual Studio\n\n\nCouldn't really develop without it. Everything from the website to all of the backend code is developed in Visual Studio.\n\n\nReSharper\n\n\nWe'd love to tell you that we type fast enough to code without ReSharper. Unfortunately this is not that case. ReSharper provides us with so many nice features to speed up development time.\n\n\nTeamCity\n\n\nDeveloping a product in 2015 without a build server is wack. We use TeamCity to build and test our internal code. For the open source parts of elmah.io, we use a combination of TeamCity provided by CodeBetter and Appveyor.\n\n\nelmah.io\n\n\nOne of the goals for elmah.io, is to be able to work as a cloud logging platform for ... well elmah.io. We eat our own dog food and use all of the features in elmah.io ourselves. In parallel, we use Serilog and Elasticsearch to log a copy of all messages. If elmah.io goes down, we always have an external log telling us what went wrong.\n\n\nMandrill\n\n\nWe send a lot of transactional mails. Various features for sending emails from elmah.io are available and for that we use Mandrill. Mandrill provides some nice templating features that we blogged about as well: \nSending transactional emails using Mandrill and .NET\n.\n\n\nNew Relic\n\n\nWe want to provide the best performing cloud logging platform out there. To keep an eye on performance and to debug when something starts performing poorly, we monitor every web request with New Relic.\n\n\nPaymill\n\n\nWe wouldn't be anywhere if we weren't able to accept payments from our users. Paymill handles all of our transactions.\n\n\nMkDocs\n\n\nWe recently switched from Wordpress to MkDocs on all of our static stuff like documentation and blog. MkDocs is a nice little documentation tool written in Python. Every article and blog post are now written in Markdown and \navailable on GitHub\n.\n\n\nFrameworks\n\n\nBesides all of the larger products and SaaS services, we use a large range of .NET frameworks for implementing and testing the various elmah.io features. NUnit, Moq and Autofixture for unit testing. Autofac for dependency injection. A range of client side libraries for building the crisp elmah.io UI like Knockout, Bootstrap, jQuery and d3. For integrating with social providers, we use SimpleAuthentication, a lightweight framework for hooking up with Facebook etc. Topshelf runs a bunch of Windows Services, hosting different consumers of our service bus, sending out emails etc.\n\n\nThat's it.

            "text": "ASP.NET Error Logging Best Practices\n\n\nThomas Ardal\n, December 1, 2015\n\n\nAdding error logging to an ASP.NET application can be quite the challenge. A lot of different tools and frameworks are available. Everyone probably know log4net, but a lot happened since the first .NET logging frameworks where conceived. This post will show you the best practices which will provide you with vital information about errors happening on your website.\n\n\nELMAH\n\n\nError logging module and handlers for ASP.NET (\nELMAH\n), the de-facto standard error component for .NET. ELMAH has existed for almost a decade but still works as wonderful as when it was initially released. The idea behind ELMAH is to log all uncaught exceptions including a lot of contextual information about the current HTTP context. ELMAH comes with a simple UI which shows you a list of errors happening and when, as well as some additional information like the type of error, the user causing the error and more.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince the ELMAH UI is available on \n/elmah.axd\n, make sure to either disallow remote access to this URL or configure ASP.NET authorization rules to only let people inside the circle of trust to access your error logs.\n\n\n\n\nYou can click each error and check out information about the server variables, cookies and other pieces of information, important to debug each error. ELMAH may not be the most hyped logging framework out there, but it works and it works great. We wouldn't implement a website without it.\n\n\n\n\nAn important note about ELMAH is to use the contrib package, matching the web framework you're using. If you develop an ASP.NET MVC application, use the \nElmah.Mvc\n package. If you develop a Nancy application, use the \nNancy.Elmah\n package etc.\n\n\n\n\nTo start using ELMAH, check out our \nELMAH Tutorial\n.\n\n\nSerilog\n\n\nELMAH only logs errors, why you probably need another logging framework to log other types of log messages like debug, information and warning messages. In theory, you could use ELMAH for other types of messages, but other logging frameworks are better suited for that need. Everyone knows log4net and NLog, but the logging framework we would like to highlight is \nSerilog\n. Serilog is a newer framework and therefore uses some of the more recent ideas behind logging as well as new libraries in .NET.\n\n\nThe idea behind Serilog is that your log messages are semantic/structured, which means that Serilog actually understands pieces of information inside your log message. Where a typical log message in log4net or NLog would look like this:\n\n\nExecuted /getuser in 15 ms\n\n\nan equivalent log message in Serilog would look like this:\n\n\nExecuted {Url} in {Elapsed} ms\n\n\nYou would then append the actual values of \nUrl\n and \nElapsed\n when logging the message to Serilog. What looks to be a simple string replace, is actually as very strong feature, where log messages suddently embeds vital and searchable information.\n\n\nSerilog implement the idea of destructoring by allowing you to log complex types to your log destinations. In theory, having the flexibility to log every .NET object seems like an awesome option. In the real world you should be very careful when logging complex objects with deep graph of references.\n\n\nUsing Serilog with a text file or relational database can be fine for testing purposes. If you want the full potential from Serilog, you need to log into a schemaless datastore like Elasticsearch, elmah.io or similar.\n\n\n\n\nWhen logging very complex objects to schemaless data stores like Elasticsearch, your mapping quickly becomes cluttered and performs poorly.\n\n\n\n\nTo start using Serilog, browse through the \nSerilog wiki\n. Also make sure to check out our Serilog sink for \nlogging to elmah.io from Serilog\n.\n\n\nCustom error pages\n\n\nDepending on how you setup your custom error pages, ELMAH and other logging frameworks may stop working. If your custom error pages actually catches the error and continues like no error happened, logging frameworks may never get notified about something bad happening.\n\n\n\n\nA good rule of thumb is to configure custom error pages as close to the IIS as possible. The closer you get to the actual ASP.NET pipeline, the more likely your error logging falls apart.\n\n\n\n\nThere's a lot of outdated tutorials on custom error pages out there. For the ultimate guide, read Dustin Moris Gorskis \nDemystifying ASP.NET MVC 5 Error Pages and Error Logging\n.",

Since the ELMAH UI is available on  /elmah.axd , make sure to either disallow remote access to this URL or configure ASP.NET authorization rules to only let people inside the circle of trust to access your error logs.   You can click each error and check out information about the server variables, cookies and other pieces of information, important to debug each error. ELMAH may not be the most hyped logging framework out there, but it works and it works great. We wouldn't implement a website without it.   An important note about ELMAH is to use the contrib package, matching the web framework you're using. If you develop an ASP.NET MVC application, use the  Elmah.Mvc  package. If you develop a Nancy application, use the  Nancy.Elmah  package etc.   To start using ELMAH, check out our  ELMAH Tutorial .",

            "text": "ELMAH only logs errors, why you probably need another logging framework to log other types of log messages like debug, information and warning messages. In theory, you could use ELMAH for other types of messages, but other logging frameworks are better suited for that need. Everyone knows log4net and NLog, but the logging framework we would like to highlight is  Serilog . Serilog is a newer framework and therefore uses some of the more recent ideas behind logging as well as new libraries in .NET.  The idea behind Serilog is that your log messages are semantic/structured, which means that Serilog actually understands pieces of information inside your log message. Where a typical log message in log4net or NLog would look like this:  Executed /getuser in 15 ms  an equivalent log message in Serilog would look like this:  Executed {Url} in {Elapsed} ms  You would then append the actual values of  Url  and  Elapsed  when logging the message to Serilog. What looks to be a simple string replace, is actually as very strong feature, where log messages suddently embeds vital and searchable information.  Serilog implement the idea of destructoring by allowing you to log complex types to your log destinations. In theory, having the flexibility to log every .NET object seems like an awesome option. In the real world you should be very careful when logging complex objects with deep graph of references.  Using Serilog with a text file or relational database can be fine for testing purposes. If you want the full potential from Serilog, you need to log into a schemaless datastore like Elasticsearch, elmah.io or similar.   When logging very complex objects to schemaless data stores like Elasticsearch, your mapping quickly becomes cluttered and performs poorly.   To start using Serilog, browse through the  Serilog wiki . Also make sure to check out our Serilog sink for  logging to elmah.io from Serilog .",

If your custom error pages actually catches the error and continues like no error happened, logging frameworks may never get notified about something bad happening.   A good rule of thumb is to configure custom error pages as close to the IIS as possible. The closer you get to the actual ASP.NET pipeline, the more likely your error logging falls apart.   There's a lot of outdated tutorials on custom error pages out there. For the ultimate guide, read Dustin Moris Gorskis  Demystifying ASP.NET MVC 5 Error Pages and Error Logging .",

            "text": "Building a scalable architecture to handle millions of errors\n\n\nThomas Ardal\n, September 5. 2015\n\n\nYou may take it for granted, but building an architecture which is able to scale to millions of messages isn\u2019t something that comes overnight. elmah.io is built to handle lots and lots of messages by utilizing some of the nice features of Windows Azure. In this post we\u2019ll show you how we\u2019ve designed elmah.io to consume errors from our customers.\n\n\nDuring the last 1\u00bd years, we\u2019ve continuously improved our architecture to handle an increasing load. Like every other startup, we didn\u2019t have the perfect architecture from day one. But we learned from our mistakes and now have a scalable architecture, which is able to handle our customer\u2019s data. A picture is worth a thousand words, and that is why looking at a diagram is probably the best way to explain our architecture:\n\n\n\n\nThe diagram illustrates the message flow from receiving a message (typically an error) from a customer, until the entire thing is persisted in the backend. We have a few components for handling emails and business rules that are not included in the diagram in order to keep it simple.\n\n\nAll messages are received through our \nAPI\n. The API is running as part of the elmah.io web application as an Azure Website. Azure Websites have a nice scaling feature, which makes it possible to increase the number of instances dynamically, based on the load on the web server. Since we don\u2019t do much other than send messages to the service bus, we rarely need to scale the number of webservers, but in situations where one of our customers experience a DDOS attack, they may indirectly start DOS attacking us by sending a lot of errors to the elmah.io API. In these situations, scaling this number of websites is extremely important, to avoid the remaining customers being punished by a single DDOS. We rely on Windows Azures to load balancers to handle any DDOS attacks and we\u2019ve implemented our own Burst Protection feature which only logs some of the errors, if thousands and thousands of messages are received from the same customer within a short period of time.\n\n\nThe reason for our API being fast, is caused by the fact that all messages are handled asynchronously. We use Azure Service Bus to handle messages, since that supports a publish/subscribe setup where multiple subscribers can consume the same message. We have multiple consumers able to store messages in various data stores, send mails, etc. All of our consumers are able to run in multiple instances, which makes it easy to spin up new consumer instances if the system has a hard time getting all of the messages processed. At the moment we have two consumers indexing data in Elasticsearch, but it can be a different number if you ask us a week from now.\n\n\nMost of the features on elmah.io are based on searches in the awesome full-text server Elasticsearch. Elasticsearch is able to index millions of documents and make them searchable with query performance in few milliseconds. We use Azure Virtual Machines to host Elasticsearch and like the rest of the architecture, we can scale the number of nodes in the cluster depending on the need. Scaling of Elasticsearch nodes is not something we do automatically, but we continuously monitor the system and scale when needed. A single Elasticsearch node can handle a large amount of documents, but by replicating across multiple nodes, it makes it possible to do maintenance on a single node, without any down time for the end user.\n\n\nElasticsearch is backed up daily, using the \nAzure plugin\n for Elasticsearch and Azure Blob Storage. This way we are able to restore one or more indexes, if something goes really bad.\n\n\nAlongside Elasticsearch, we also store all messages in Azure Blob Storage. We like the idea of keeping customer data in at least two data stores. In cases where Elasticsearch data is lost and the backup cannot be used to restore the indexes, we are able to restore everything from Azure Blob Storage. Luckily we\u2019ve never actually needed to use data in Blob Storage, but having the data makes it a lot easier to sleep at night :) Blob Storage is a nice place to store data since it\u2019s highly scalable and geo replicated.\n\n\nThat wraps it up. We\u2019ve done everything in our power to make elmah.io scalable. Using a solution like Windows Azure where something that we thought a lot about when launching. It seemed expensive at the time, but when looking back, we would\u2019ve used a lot more developer hours in order to achieve the same scalable architecture using a homemade setup on cheap virtual machines somewhere else.\n\n\nFuture\n\n\nWe are quite confident that our current architecture will handle the increased load for at least a year, but as we see an increase in customers, we also will see increase in data. Since we don\u2019t want to sit our hands waiting for accidents to happen, we are already working to improve the architecture even more. In the next version of the API (version 3) we want to split the website and API in two parts. This would allow our website to be down, without the API being affected.\n\n\nWe also want to look more into the Traffic Manager in Windows Azure, which makes it possible to scale websites across multiple regions. This improves response time for our customers, since web requests are handled by the nearest data center.\n\n\nA third improvement could be to our service bus, which potentially can be a bottleneck in our current architecture. We are working on multiple ways to address this. One thing is to collect failing requests to the elmah.io API in the .NET client. In fact we already implemented this in the \nlatest prerelease\n. Another area could be to scale Service Bus or switch to another messaging technology like RabbitMQ. But since a service bus is the least of our worries at the moments, changes to this component probably won\u2019t be the first to see the light of day.",

You may not know Mandrill, but it\u2019s a transactional email service, developed by the same guys that build Mailchimp. Disclamer: we are not affiliated with Mandrill but simply love them so much, that we\u2019ve decided to blog about it.\n\n\nThe awesome part of Mandrill is, that it supports email templates with merge capabilities which we utilize to generate the \nNew Error email\n as well as the \nDaily Digest email\n. Until now we\u2019ve used the so-cald Mailchimp template syntax, which includes adding merge codes in HTML attributes to add dynamic contents to an email. Last year Mandrill rolled out support for using the \nHandlebars.js\n engine, which we already know, love and use on another product that we\u2019ve build called \nGibbon.io\n. It seemed obvious to switch to using Handlebars.js in our mail templates as well.\n\n\nTo start using Handlebars.js and Mandrill, you will need to define an email template on Mandrill. An email template contains the HTML code for generating the mail, including the code to generate dynamic content. In this example, we\u2019ll go with a simple mail, containing a couple of widely used handlesbars code snippets:\n\n\nh1\nWelcome {{name}}\n/h1\n\n\nul\n\n    {{#each fruits}}\n    \nli\n{{this}}\n/li\n\n    {{/each}}\n\n/ul\n\n\n\n\n\nA simple mail with a welcome message and a list of fruits. Probably not the most informative mail, but you get the point here. The fun part of the email template is the handlebars code embedded in the \n{{}}\n syntax. To input a name into the welcome headline, we reference a variable named \nname\n. To create more dynamic content (in this case a list), you can use the \n#each\n syntax to iterate over an array of data.\n\n\nTo generate a new email based on this template, we\u2019re using a .NET client simply named Mandrill. Start by creating a new instance of the MandrillApi type:\n\n\nvar mandrillApi = new MandrillApi(\nAPIKEY\n);\n\n\n\n\nYou need to replace the APIKEY with your own key found at the Mandrill website. Using the API object, you will be able to send email messages using Mandrills REST API. Create a new \nEmailMessage\n object:\n\n\nvar emailMessage = new EmailMessage\n{\n    MergeLanguage = TemplateSyntax.Handlebars,\n    Subject = \nWelcome message\u201d,\n    To = new[] {new EmailAddress(emailAddress)}\n};\n\n\n\n\nIn this example, I\u2019ve already setup from email in the email template, but you will be able to specify that using the .NET client if you please.\n\n\nTo generate the dynamic content for handlebars to do its magic, you specify global variables on the email message:\n\n\nemailMessage.AddGlobalVariable(\nname\n, customer.Name);\nemailMessage.AddGlobalVariable(\nfruits\n, new[] {\u201cApple\u201d, \u201cOrange\u201d, \u201cPear\u201d}.ToList());\n\n\n\n\nFinally we tell the client to send the email:\n\n\nvar result = await mandrillApi.SendMessageTemplate(\n    new SendMessageTemplateRequest(emailMessage, \u201ctemplateslug\u201d, null));\n\n\n\n\nThe client supports \nasync\n only, why you need to \nawait\n the result of the \nSendMessageTemplate\n method. The first argument contains the \nEmailMessage\n that we created in a previous step. The second argument contains the name (slug) of the template we created on the Mandrill website. Since we\u2019ve already generated global variables for handlebars, we set the third parameter to \nnull\n. In case you\u2019d want to use the Mailchimp template language, this is where you would ship off data to Mandrill.\n\n\nThat\u2019s it! Mandrill will trigger handlebars to replace the dynamic content in the mail template and send off the email to the customer.",

To read the most updated version, please check out \nLogging to multiple logs\n.\n\n\n\n\nFrom time to time, we keep hearing the same types of questions like \u201cI just want to try elmah.io, but still want to log errors to my local SQL Server\u201d or \u201cI only want to log some of my errors to elmah.io\u201d and so on. In this post, we\u2019ll show you just how to accomplish that.\n\n\nUnfortunately, ELMAH doesn\u2019t support multiple log targets like other logging frameworks like Serilog. This makes logging to multiple logs a bit tricky, but no way impossible. Let\u2019s say that you\u2019re using ELMAH in your web application and configured it to log everything in SQL Server. If you look through your web.config file, you will have code looking like this somewhere:\n\n\nelmah\n\n    \nerrorLog type=\nElmah.SqlErrorLog, Elmah\n connectionStringName=\nelmah\n/\n\n\n/elmah\n\n\n\n\n\nAs you probably know, this tells ELMAH to log all uncatched errors in SQL Server with the connection string \u201celmah\u201d. You cannot add more \nerrorLog\n elements, why logging to a second log seems impossible. Meet ELMAH\u2019s Logged event, which is a great hook to log to multiple targets.

When called we create a new \nElmah.Io.ErrorLog\n instance with the GUID of your log at elmah.io. Next we simply call the Log method with a new Error object. Bam! The error is logged both in SQL Server and in elmah.io.\n\n\nIf you only want to log certain types of errors in elmah.io, but everything to your normal log, you can extend your code like this:\n\n\nvoid ErrorLog_Logged(object sender, ErrorLoggedEventArgs args)\n{\n    if (args.Entry.Error.StatusCode == 500)\n    {\n        var elmahIoLog = new Elmah.Io.ErrorLog(new Logger(new Guid(\ninsert your log id\n)));\n        elmahIoLog.Log(args.Entry.Error);\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\nThis time we only begin logging to elmah.io, if the thrown exception is of type HttpException and contains a HTTP status code of 500.",

From time to time, we keep hearing the same types of questions like \u201cI just want to try elmah.io, but still want to log errors to my local SQL Server\u201d or \u201cI only want to log some of my errors to elmah.io\u201d and so on. In this post, we\u2019ll show you just how to accomplish that.  Unfortunately, ELMAH doesn\u2019t support multiple log targets like other logging frameworks like Serilog. This makes logging to multiple logs a bit tricky, but no way impossible. Let\u2019s say that you\u2019re using ELMAH in your web application and configured it to log everything in SQL Server. If you look through your web.config file, you will have code looking like this somewhere:  elmah \n     errorLog type= Elmah.SqlErrorLog, Elmah  connectionStringName= elmah /  /elmah   As you probably know, this tells ELMAH to log all uncatched errors in SQL Server with the connection string \u201celmah\u201d. You cannot add more  errorLog  elements, why logging to a second log seems impossible. Meet ELMAH\u2019s Logged event, which is a great hook to log to multiple targets. Install the  elmah.io.core  NuGet package and add the following code to your global.asax.cs file:  void ErrorLog_Logged(object sender, ErrorLoggedEventArgs args)\n{\n    var elmahIoLog = new Elmah.Io.ErrorLog(new Logger(new Guid( insert your log id )));\n    elmahIoLog.Log(args.Entry.Error);\n}  In the above code, we listen for the Logged event by simply declaring a method named  ErrorLog_Logged .

The new API have been available for the last three months through the website and a prerelease NuGet package. This week we finished all the missing pieces for the \nnew API\n to go out of beta.\n\n\nLike discussed in the beta announcement, the v2 API is not bound to neither ELMAH nor the error XML format inside ELMAH. So this may not affect you if you\u2019re using elmah.io to log un-catched exceptions from your website, but it definitely gives you some new possibilities listed below.\n\n\nSeverities\n\n\nWe have been working on improving message severities on elmah.io for the last couple of months. ELMAH natively doesn\u2019t contain the concept of a severity or level known from other logging frameworks like log4net and Serilog. The elmah.io client now have fully support for 6 levels of severities: Verbose, Debug, Information, Warning, Error and Fatal. When logging errors through elmah.io\u2019s ErrorLog implementation for ELMAH, we assign a severity to the error, based on the status code. If you are logging to elmah.io manually (see below), you have the option of assigning a severity to each message.\n\n\nelmah.io.client\n\n\nThere\u2019s a new NuGet package in town. elmah.io previously provided two NuGet packages for hooking up error handling to your website: elmah.io and elmah.io.core. While elmah.io.core contained the ErrorLog implementation, as well as the code for communicating with elmah.io\u2019s API, the elmah.io package contained the web.config changes only. The 2.0 client still contains the two existing packages, but elmah.io.core have been split into core and client (elmah.io.client). The client contains the code for communicating with the new API and contains a nice logging interface inspired by popular logging frameworks like log4net. You can create a new logger and start logging messages to elmah.io, without changing a single line of code in your web.config and you can even log messages from console, wpf and other kinds of apps:\n\n\nvar logger = Logger.Create(new Guid(\ncc6043e9-5d7b-4986-8056-cb76d4d52e5e\n));\nlogger.Error(new ApplicationException(), \nMessage attached the error\n);\nlogger.Information(\nSome kind of information message\n);\n\n\n\n\nSerilog Sink\n\n\nMichiel van Oudheusden wrote an integration to elmah.io from the popular logging framework Serilog last year. Because elmah.io only supported errors in the past, the match where not perfect. After releasing the v2 API, we\u2019ve had the possibility to redo everything inside the elmah.io sink for Serilog, making the two tools new best friends. With the new sink, you can log messages of all Serilog levels to elmah.io, using recognizable code like this:\n\n\nLog.Logger =\n    new LoggerConfiguration()\n        .MinimumLevel.Verbose()\n        .WriteTo.ElmahIO(new Guid(\ncc6043e9-5d7b-4986-8056-cb76d4d52e5e\n))\n        .CreateLogger();\nLog.Information(\nThis in an info message\n);\nLog.Verbose(\nThis in a verbose message\n);\nLog.Fatal(new SystemException(), \nThis is a fatal message\n);\n\n\n\n\nWe hope that making it way easier to integrate with elmah.io, will give birth to some interesting new use cases. In fact we are giving away 6 month of free subscriptions to anyone creating a cool integration to elmah.io. Please get in touch if you have created an integration for elmah.io. We are already seeing integrations for different logging frameworks like Serilog and Logary, but only time will show what you come up with.

To read the most updated version, please check out \nLogging custom data\n.\n\n\n\n\nTime for a new feature which a lot of you\u2019ve asked for either on elmah.io or ELMAH in general: logging custom data.\n\n\nELMAH stores a lot of contextual information when an error occur. Things like cookies, stacktrace, server variables and much more are stored to ease debugging the error at a later point in time. Since the schema of ELMAH is defined by the people behind ELMAH itself, there\u2019s no really good way of enriching an error with custom variables. Until now! In the latest \nprerelease\n of the new v2 elmah.io client, you can add custom variables to an error, before it is send off to elmah.io\u2019s API.\n\n\nLet\u2019s look at some code. You have two options of decorating your errors with custom variables.\n\n\nUse the \nData\n dictionary on .NET\u2019s Exception type\n\n\nI talk to a lot of developers and not all of them know about the wonderful world of the Data dictionary. All exceptions in .NET contains a property named Data and of type IDictionary. The Data dictionary is intended for user-defined information about the exception. The elmah.io client iterates through key/values in this dictionary and ship it off to elmah.io\u2019s API. To log custom data using Data, just add a new key/value pair to the Data dictionary:\n\n\ntry\n{\n    CallSomeBusinessLogic(inputValue);\n}\ncatch (Exception e)\n{\n    e.Data.Add(\nInputValueWas\n, inputValue);\n    ErrorSignal.FromCurrentContext().Raise(e);\n}\n\n\n\n\nIn the example I add a custom variable named \nInputValueWas\n with the value of the \ninputValue\n variable. This way I will be able to see which input value caused the exception.\n\n\nUse the OnMessage hook in the elmah.io client prerelease\n\n\nYou may not use ELMAH\u2019s ErrorSignal feature, but rely on ELMAH to log uncaught exceptions only. In this scenario you probably don\u2019t have access to the thrown exception. The elmah.io client offers a hook for you to be able to execute code every time something is logged:\n\n\nLogger.OnMessage += (sender, args) =\n\n{\n    if (args.Message.Data == null) args.Message.Data = new List\nItem\n();\n    args.Message.Data.Add(new Item { Key = \nSomeOtherVariable\n, Value = someVariable });\n};\n\n\n\n\nYou may not have seen the Logger type of elmah.io before, but what\u2019s important to know right now is, that Logger is responsible for logging messages to the elmah.io API. Another new term here is Message. A message is the type encapsulating all of the information about the thrown exception.\n\n\nIn the code example I subscribe a new event handler to the \nOnMessage\n event. This tells the elmah.io client to execute your event handler, before actually logging an exception to elmah.io. I use the event to add a custom variable to the Data dictionary of the message logged to elmah.io.\n\n\nLooking at your custom variables\n\n\nLogging custom data doesn\u2019t really make anything easier, unless you have a place to show them. Luckily for you, we have thought about that and now offers a new tab on the error details:\n\n\n\n\nLike the content in the other tabs of the error details, you will be able to filter results by the variable key.",

The elmah.io client iterates through key/values in this dictionary and ship it off to elmah.io\u2019s API. To log custom data using Data, just add a new key/value pair to the Data dictionary:  try\n{\n    CallSomeBusinessLogic(inputValue);\n}\ncatch (Exception e)\n{\n    e.Data.Add( InputValueWas , inputValue);\n    ErrorSignal.FromCurrentContext().Raise(e);\n}  In the example I add a custom variable named  InputValueWas  with the value of the  inputValue  variable.

First of all we\u2019ve switched to JSON and a much purer REST implementation. Second, the error XML have been replaced with a custom format which we simply call \nMessage\n. A message is unlike Error from V1, simply a wrapper for logging and retrieving data to and from elmah.io. ELMAH doesn\u2019t contain the concept of a severity like most other logging frameworks.

This article will explain exactly how the two logging frameworks vary. Let\u2019s start by defining each tool.\n\n\nELMAH\n\n\nELMAH is an error logging framework originally developed by Atif Aziz able to log all unhandled exceptions from .NET web applications. Errors can be logged to a variety of destinations through ELMAH\u2019s plugin model called error logs. Plugins for XML, SQL Server, MySQL, Elasticsearch and many more exists. ELMAH automatically collects a lot of information from the HTTP context when logging the error, giving you the possibility to inspect request parameters, cookies and much more for the failed request. Custom errors can be logged to ELMAH, by manually calling the error log.\n\n\nAdvantages\n\n\n\n\nAutomatically logs unhandled exceptions.\n\n\nCollects a lot of useful information about the failing HTTP request.\n\n\nComes with an UI.\n\n\nBroadly adopted by the community.\n\n\n\n\nlog4net\n\n\nlog4net is a port of the popular Java logging framework log4j. Like log4j, log4net is maintained by the Apache Software Foundation. log4net is a generic logging framework able to log both errors and other types of logging (debug, information etc.). log4net needs to be invoked manually and therefore doesn\u2019t log anything automatic. log4net comes with multiple plugins (called appenders) able to log errors to pretty much every destination out there.\n\n\nAdvantages\n\n\n\n\nOutput to multiple logging destinations.\n\n\nLogs both debug, information, errors etc.\n\n\nBroadly adopted by the community.\n\n\n\n\nWhat should you choose?\n\n\nThe depends. If you want a log of every unhandled exceptions on you website, you should go with ELMAH. If you want to keep a log file containing other types of logging than errors, your should go with log4net. In most use cases, it really makes sense to use both and the one doesn't rule the other one out.\n\n\nTo wrap it up, we\u2019ve taken the best from both worlds and put it into elmah.io. Besides all of the advantages from ELMAH, elmah.io also support multiple logging destinations and messages levels (debug, information etc.). Register for free at elmah.io to start logging. You can also log directly to elmah.io from log4net by following the \nLogging to elmah.io from log4net guide\n.",

Besides all of the advantages from ELMAH, elmah.io also support multiple logging destinations and messages levels (debug, information etc.). Register for free at elmah.io to start logging.

To start browsing your logs, hit the log in icon to the left: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLog in with the social account used on elmah.io: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen logged on, the Log combo box contains a list of your logs. Select one and hit the search icon: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere you go: full elmah.io log browsing support inside VS. You can double click each row and check out the details directly on the elmah.io website.\n\n\nWe have a lot in store for the extension. But as usual we\u2019d love your feedback so please try out the extension and get back to use through \nUserVoice\n, \nTwitter\n or \nEmail\n or the \nelmah.io Browser details page\n on the Visual Studio gallery.",

We spend almost all of our day inside Visual Studio coding, why integrating error logs inside our favorite IDE was an obvious choice. Let me show you how to get up and running.    Inside Visual Studio navigate to Tools | Extensions and Updates | Online and search for elmah.io:     Hit Download and restart Visual Studio.    You\u2019ll find the elmah.io Browser through View | Other Windows | elmah.io Browser or by searching for it through Quick Launch (Ctrl+Q).    When launched, a new tool window appears, which can be docked if you\u2019d like. To start browsing your logs, hit the log in icon to the left:     Log in with the social account used on elmah.io:     When logged on, the Log combo box contains a list of your logs. Select one and hit the search icon:     There you go: full elmah.io log browsing support inside VS. You can double click each row and check out the details directly on the elmah.io website.  We have a lot in store for the extension. But as usual we\u2019d love your feedback so please try out the extension and get back to use through  UserVoice ,  Twitter  or  Email  or the  elmah.io Browser details page  on the Visual Studio gallery.",

The beta sign is gone and a lot of exiting stuff have happened since the first alpha. We really think that we have built a product, which will save you hours and make your everyday fun and focused.\n\n\nWhy this post then? Along the official launch, we\u2019re also ready to introduce paid plans on elmah.io. Luckily for all of you beta testers, we still offer a free plan and all of your logs are automatically moved to the free plan. So why introduce pricing at all? Well as you probably know, running a website isn\u2019t free. To keep the releases flowing and to give us a change to innovate on this already awesome platform, we really hope that you will consider supporting us, by purchasing one of our paid plans. We have a lot of ideas on how to make elmah.io even cooler and we need your help to do that. Check out the Plans and Pricing page for details. To purchase a plan, log in to elmah.io and visit the profile page.\n\n\nIf you haven\u2019t visited us for a while, let us use a few lines to introduce some of the great features we have been building recently. In November we introduced \nLucene search\n, making it possible to write advanced queries against your errors. In December we gave you the much sought \nHTTPS support\n. In January \nIgnore Filters\n which later on matured into an \nadvanced rule engine\n, making it possible for you to react through mail and/or web hooks, when new errors occur. Recently we introduced the new \nOverview tab\n, which in a simple way visualizes your recent error activity.\n\n\nAs usual please reach out if you have ideas for elmah.io either through \nUserVoice\n, \nTwitter\n or \nEmail\n.\n\n\nThank you for your support!",

Luckily for all of you beta testers, we still offer a free plan and all of your logs are automatically moved to the free plan. So why introduce pricing at all? Well as you probably know, running a website isn\u2019t free. To keep the releases flowing and to give us a change to innovate on this already awesome platform, we really hope that you will consider supporting us, by purchasing one of our paid plans. We have a lot of ideas on how to make elmah.io even cooler and we need your help to do that. Check out the Plans and Pricing page for details. To purchase a plan, log in to elmah.io and visit the profile page.  If you haven\u2019t visited us for a while, let us use a few lines to introduce some of the great features we have been building recently. In November we introduced  Lucene search , making it possible to write advanced queries against your errors. In December we gave you the much sought  HTTPS support . In January  Ignore Filters  which later on matured into an  advanced rule engine , making it possible for you to react through mail and/or web hooks, when new errors occur. Recently we introduced the new  Overview tab , which in a simple way visualizes your recent error activity.  As usual please reach out if you have ideas for elmah.io either through  UserVoice ,  Twitter  or  Email .  Thank you for your support!",

In this post I would like to highlight a single thing: Say hello to \nmy little friend\n the new overview tab!\n\n\n\n\nThe overview page is a great addition to the three existing (and awesome) tabs, visualizing your log in different ways. The idea behind the overview tab is to give you a quick overview of the errors happening within the last 24 hours. You will be directed to the new tab automatically, when you visit your log. The overview tab can be used at your desktop and mobile device, but the page is optimized to be presented on a flat screen as well.\n\n\nIn the top you will find a graph showing when the errors are happening throughout the day. You may recognize this graph from the dashboard.\n\n\nSummary\n\n\nTo the left there are 4 boxes showing a summarized view of all of the errors. The Total box shows the total count of errors. The Unique box shows you if the same errors are happening over and over again or if the errors are different. The Users box shows you how many users are affected by the errors. The users count is based by logged in users, why this only works if your website supports this. The Browsers box shows how many browsers are affected. For now we don\u2019t group any of the browsers in this count, why different versions of Firefox or Chrome would count as individual browsers. This leads us to the next section, which actually groups browsers.\n\n\n\n\nBrowsers\n\n\nBelow the totals, there\u2019s an indicator showing the 5 most popular browsers. If a browser is affected during the last 24 hours, the browser icon will light up (using the black color). Unaffected browsers are painted light gray.\n\n\n\n\nGauges\n\n\nTo the right we have added 4 gauges. We will be adding more widgets here, but until now you will be able to see how many Critical (status code 500) and Not Found (status code 404) errors occurred. The Recent Errors gauge shows you how many of the total errors which have occurred during the last hour. This way you will be able to monitor if a lot of errors are logged after you release a new version of your software. The final gauge shows the count of the Most Frequent errors compared to the total count. This will help you determine if the same error is happening multiple times.\n\n\n\n\nWe will keep adding features to the new tab, helping you get a better overview of your errors. The following ideas are in the pipeline:\n\n\nMore widgets\n\n\n\n\nPossible to click the widgets and get directly to the search result\n\n\nAuto-refresh\n\n\nPossible to adjust the timespan to show errors from the last 5 minutes, last hour etc.\n\n\nMove the features from the Statistics tab to the Overview tab.",

To read the most updated version, please check out \nLogging from Serilog\n\n\n\n\nSerilog is a great addition to the flowering .NET logging community, described as \u201cA no-nonse logging library for the NoSQL era\u201d on their project page. Serilog works as other logging frameworks like log4net and NLog, but offers a great fluent API and the concept of sinks (a bit like appenders in log4net). Sinks are superior to appenders, because they threat errors as objects rather than strings, a perfect fit for elmah.io which itself is build on NoSQL. Serilog already comes with native support for elmah.io, which makes it easy to integrate with any application using Serilog.\n\n\nIn this example we\u2019ll use a ASP.NET MVC project as an example. Neither Serilog nor elmah.io are bound to log errors from web applications, why adding this type of logging to your windows and console applications is just as easy. Add the Serilog.Sinks.ElmahIO NuGet package to your project:\n\n\nInstall-Package Serilog.Sinks.ElmahIO\n\n\n\n\nDuring the installation you will be prompted to input your log id, as with any other installation of elmah.io. To configure Serilog, add the following code to the Application_Start method in global.asax.cs (where LOG_ID is your log id):\n\n\nvar log =\n    new LoggerConfiguration()\n        .WriteTo.ElmahIO(new Guid(\nLOG_ID\n))\n        .CreateLogger();\nLog.Logger = log;\n\n\n\n\nFirst we create a new LoggerConfiguration and tell it to write to elmah.io. The log object can be used to log errors and you should register this in your IoC container. In this case we don\u2019t use IoC, why the log object is set as the public static Logger property, which makes it accessible from everywhere.\n\n\nWhen unhandled exceptions occur, ELMAH ships the errors to elmah.io through the elmah.io NuGet package. No Serilog or even magic is happening there. The fun part begins when we log handled exceptions to Serilog:\n\n\ntry {\n    // Do some stuff which may cause an exception\n}\ncatch (Exception e) {\n    Log.Error(e, \nThe actual error message\n);\n}\n\n\n\n\nThe Error method tells Serilog to log the error in the configured sinks, which in our case logs to elmah.io.

In fact ELMAH works out of the box for most web frameworks by Microsoft. If you are building and deploying the code yourself, installing elmah.io is achieved using our NuGet package:\n\n\nInstall-Package elmah.io\n\n\n\n\nDuring the installation you need to input your log id, located in the settings. When installed, BlogEngine.NET starts reporting errors to elmah.io. To check it out, force an internal server error or similar, and visit /elmah.axd or the search area of your log at elmah.io.\n\n\nSome of you may use the BlogEngine.NET binaries or even installed it using a one-click installer. In this case you will need to add elmah.io manually. To do that, use a tool like NuGet Package Explorer to download the most recent versions of ELMAH and elmah.io. Copy Elmah.dll and Elmah.Io.dll to the bin directory of your BlogEngine.NET installation. Also modify your web.config to include the ELMAH config as shown in the config example.

This release contains some exiting new stuff as well as the usual bug fixes and tweaks to make elmah.io the best cloud logging service out there.\n\n\nRe-designed Dashboard\n\n\nLike any good company, we eat our own dog food and use elmah.io for every project we do (including elmah.io itself). Navigating between the Dashboard, Search and Settings pages were quite extensive. We were surprised how often you guys did that and we decided to collect all of your feedback into a total re-design of the Dashboard page:\n\n\n\n\nFrom the new Dashboard page, you can navigate directly to both Search and Settings of all of your logs.\n\n\nRules\n\n\nRemember Ignore Filters introduced in the previous release? Well, meet Rules. To support further development on this feature, we\u2019ve decided to rename Ignore Filters to Rules. Rules will grow into a feature rich rule engine, making it possible for you to execute actions based on search filters. For now the only action is Ignore. Specifying a new search filter with an Ignore action, gives you exactly the same behavior as the previous Ignore Filters. Stay tuned for more actions like Send Mail and HTTP Request.\n\n\n\n\nTrac Support\n\n\nSome of you really wanted support for Trac.

Disclamer: this is in no way an official guide on how to setup ElasticSearch in a cluster. My experience with replication in ElasticSearch is pretty limited, and I only just now found out how virtual networks work in Windows Azure. Use this guide for inspiration and I would love to get some feedback on the approach used.\n\n\nIf you don\u2019t have access to Azure, there\u2019s a free trial available from the frontpage: http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/pricing/free-trial/. You will get 30 days of Azure with a maximum of $200 worth of services. Pricing on Azure has always been a nightmare, but $200 should do just fine in order to play around with a couple of VMs. When signed up and in, start by creating a new virtual network:\n\n\n\n\nInput a name and create a new affinity group. For now we will just input values and discuss the details later:\n\n\n\n\nIn the DNS Servers and VPN Connectivity step just click Next and Azure will control the DNS. The final step should look something like this:\n\n\n\n\nWhen finished click the Complete checkmark. So let\u2019s rewind and talk about what we have done here. The virtual network is not necessary in order for ElasticSearch to work, but it makes it a hell of a lot easier, because all of the virtual machines on the same network will be able to communicate with each other, without you should worry about anything than allowing the connections through the firewall. More about that later.\n\n\nI won\u2019t go into details about the affinity group, but you can read a great introduction to affinity groups on Azure here: \nhttp://convective.wordpress.com/2012/06/10/affinity-groups-in-windows-azure/\n. Just think of the affinity group as a single container at Microsoft. Having all of your services in the same container, improves performance when communicating between different computers inside that container.\n\n\nElasticSearch requires some iron to execute. Let\u2019s create a new virtual machine:\n\n\n\n\nWe want a data center edition of Windows to run our cluster:\n\n\n\n\nGive you VM a name and pick a size of your choice:\n\n\n\n\nIn the following step, we will use the new virtual network we just created. But before that, select the Create a new cloud service option from the Cloud Service select box. Cloud Services is a funny thing in Azure, because it maps to both a way of implementing web sites (web roles) and background jobs (worker roles) as well as to scale other services like virtual machines. In the Virtual Network select box, choose the elasticsearch-cluster network or whatever you decided to name it:\n\n\n\n\nLeave the endpoints as is and click the Complete check mark:\n\n\n\n\nA few minutes later, your virtual machine will be up and running. We could go on and install ElasticSearch now, but one machine doesn\u2019t smell like a cluster, right? You guessed what next: more VMs! I\u2019ve always considered two nodes running a piece of software in a cluster as safe, but my time at eBay taught me, that you\u2019d always want three nodes in a cluster. It\u2019s probably up for debate, but having only two nodes doesn\u2019t really make it a cluster every time you need to take one out for patching or similar. That\u2019s why we create two additional VMs. The steps are exactly the same as above, except the Cloud Service select box where you should choose the es-vms cloud service you\u2019ve already created.\n\n\nI\u2019m assuming that you have three VM\u2019s up and running:\n\n\n\n\nNow for the boring part: installing ElasticSearch. Actually it\u2019s quite simple, but I wont go into detail on it, because it\u2019s fairly well documented here in the \nInstallation part\n. You might argue that we could do with installing ElasticSearch on a single VM and using that as a template for the other two VMs. You\u2019re right! Azure supports creating new VMs from existing virtual discs, but I\u2019ve never really tried, why I don\u2019t want to write something rubbish. For now just install ElasticSearch on the three VMs.\n\n\nRemember when I told the advantages about added all of the VMs to the same virtual network?  Well now it\u2019s time to collect. ElasticSearch supports different types of discovery, which in plain words makes multiple ElasticSearch instances talk to each other. The default type of discovery is multicast where you do not need to configure anything. Unfortunately multicast doesn\u2019t seem to work on Azure (yet), why we need to configure this using unicast. On each VM, open the elasticsearch.yml located in the config directory of ElasticSearch and search for \n\u201c# discovery.zen.ping.multicast.enabled: false\u201d\n. In order for ElasticSearch to use unicast, uncomment this line. Also you need to setup the IPs of the other ElasticSearch instances in our virtual network. In my case, the following line does the trick:\n\n\ndiscovery.zen.ping.unicast.hosts: [\u201c10.0.0.4\u201d, \u201c10.0.0.5\u201d, \u201c10.0.0.6\u201d]\n\n\nThe IP addresses visible from the dashboard of each VM. Make sure that you pick the internal IPs. Finally you need to specify the same cluster name for all instances using this line:\n\n\ncluster.name: elasticsearch\n\n\nElasticSearch communicates between nodes on port 9300 and accepts connections from the outside on port 9200, why you need to allow inbound access on these ports in Windows Firewall. Copy the elasticsearch.yml around and start ElasticSearch on all the VMs. Congratulations! You now have your first ElasticSearch cluster up and running.\n\n\nTo communicate with your new cluster from a Azure website or something outside Microsofts datacenters, you need access to port port 9200 on all of the VMs. If you inspect the public IPs if all three VMs you will notice, that it\u2019s the same. All three ElasticSearch instances will be able to handle requests on this IP, but in order to do so, you need to configure load balancing on Azure. Load balancing in azure is implemented in a real simple way through Endpoints. Navigate to the endpoints tab of one of your VMs and create a new endpoint:\n\n\n\n\nIn the following step input a name and port 9200 in both Public and Private Port. Make sure to check the Create a load balanced set:\n\n\n\n\nIn the final step assign a name to the new load balanced endpoint and accept the default values in the rest of the fields:\n\n\n\n\nThe only thing missing is creating the same endpoint on the remaining two virtual machines. Remember to select the existing load balanced set when creating the new endpoints. This makes Azure load balance incoming request to port 9200 on the IP of the VMs.\n\n\nIn my setup I\u2019ve installed Head plugin for ElasticSearch, which makes it possible to visualize a new index on my cluster for you guys:",

Azure supports creating new VMs from existing virtual discs, but I\u2019ve never really tried, why I don\u2019t want to write something rubbish. For now just install ElasticSearch on the three VMs.  Remember when I told the advantages about added all of the VMs to the same virtual network?  Well now it\u2019s time to collect. ElasticSearch supports different types of discovery, which in plain words makes multiple ElasticSearch instances talk to each other. The default type of discovery is multicast where you do not need to configure anything. Unfortunately multicast doesn\u2019t seem to work on Azure (yet), why we need to configure this using unicast. On each VM, open the elasticsearch.yml located in the config directory of ElasticSearch and search for  \u201c# discovery.zen.ping.multicast.enabled: false\u201d . In order for ElasticSearch to use unicast, uncomment this line. Also you need to setup the IPs of the other ElasticSearch instances in our virtual network. In my case, the following line does the trick:  discovery.zen.ping.unicast.hosts: [\u201c10.0.0.4\u201d, \u201c10.0.0.5\u201d, \u201c10.0.0.6\u201d]  The IP addresses visible from the dashboard of each VM. Make sure that you pick the internal IPs. Finally you need to specify the same cluster name for all instances using this line:  cluster.name: elasticsearch  ElasticSearch communicates between nodes on port 9300 and accepts connections from the outside on port 9200, why you need to allow inbound access on these ports in Windows Firewall. Copy the elasticsearch.yml around and start ElasticSearch on all the VMs. Congratulations! You now have your first ElasticSearch cluster up and running.  To communicate with your new cluster from a Azure website or something outside Microsofts datacenters, you need access to port port 9200 on all of the VMs. If you inspect the public IPs if all three VMs you will notice, that it\u2019s the same. All three ElasticSearch instances will be able to handle requests on this IP, but in order to do so, you need to configure load balancing on Azure. Load balancing in azure is implemented in a real simple way through Endpoints. Navigate to the endpoints tab of one of your VMs and create a new endpoint:   In the following step input a name and port 9200 in both Public and Private Port. Make sure to check the Create a load balanced set:   In the final step assign a name to the new load balanced endpoint and accept the default values in the rest of the fields:   The only thing missing is creating the same endpoint on the remaining two virtual machines. Remember to select the existing load balanced set when creating the new endpoints. This makes Azure load balance incoming request to port 9200 on the IP of the VMs.  In my setup I\u2019ve installed Head plugin for ElasticSearch, which makes it possible to visualize a new index on my cluster for you guys:",

Can this be done?\u201d The answer is of course: Yes! The elmah.io NuGet package has some tricks up its sleeve, making it not only an ErrorLog implementation for ELMAH, but also a client you can utilize in your .NET applications.

The class contain multiple constructors, but if you want to use elmah.io for custom logging, pick the one accepting your Log Id (found at the dashboard on elmah.io). In line 27 we need to log the exception when the division throws an exception.

            "text": "ELMAH Elasticsearch Tutorial\n\n\nThomas Ardal\n, September 4. 2013\n\n\n\n\nThis article shows how Elasticsearch can be used as a logging backend for ELMAH. A basic knowledge about ELMAH is a prerequisite to reading this article. If you\u2019re new to ELMAH, please read our \nELMAH Tutorial\n.\n\n\n\n\nElasticsearch\n\n\nSo what\u2019s \nElasticsearch\n and why is it ideal for storing ELMAH errors? To answer the first question, Elasticsearch is a powerful search engine based on Lucene indexes. Why do we think it\u2019s ideal to store ELMAH errors? Well because of three things in fact: Search, Search and Search! Nobody wants to log errors from their webserver, without being able to search them. Elasticsearch provides some really kick-ass search mechanisms, which simply isn\u2019t possible in a SQL Database or requires a lot of knowledge about configuring individual products.\n\n\nElmah.Io.Elasticsearch\n\n\nAt \nelmah.io\n we love ELMAH and Elasticsearch so much, that we wrote our own implementation of a ELMAH error logger for Elasticsearch. The code is \nopen sourced\n at GitHub and we accept pull requests as well as feature requests like pretty much any other open source project. Elmah.Io.Elasticsearch is in fact a competitor to elmah.io itself, because you could build your own UI on top of our NuGet package. We believe that our product is strong enough for you to want to try it out anyway.\n\n\nElmah.Io.Elasticsearch is distributed through NuGet and works like any other error log implementation for ELMAH. Before we start looking at the ELMAH configuration, let\u2019s install Elasticsearch.\n\n\nInstallation\n\n\nBefore installing Elasticsearch, you need to install a Java JRE. We know it sounds like a world of pain, but Elasticsearch is based on Java and therefore require you to install it :( Just do us a favor and unclick the option which tries to cheat you into installing the Ask toolbar. Java is downloaded from the \ndownload page\n.\n\n\nNow that we forever infected our machine (3 billion devices is infected with Java, right?), we are ready to install Elasticsearch. Head over to the \nElasticsearch download page\n and download the Zip. When downloaded unpack the zip somewhere on your hard drive. Locate the bin folder and double click elasticsearch.bat. If everything have been setup correctly (you probably will experience some sort of obscure Java problem like JAVA_HOME not being specified), Elasticsearch should startup in a new command prompt:\n\n\n\n\nHooray! Elasticsearch is running.\n\n\nConfiguring ELMAH\n\n\nWe know we promised some configuration. Before doing that you need to install the Elmah.Elasticsearch NuGet package (name differ to align with other storage packages for ELMAH):\n\n\nInstall-Package Elmah.Elasticsearch\n\n\n\n\n... and now for the XML. The downloaded NuGet packages already added a hell of a lot of XML to your web.config. In order for ELMAH to use the Elasticsearch error logger, located in the Elmah.Io.Elasticsearch assembly, locate the \nelmah\n element and make it look like so:\n\n\nelmah\n\n  \nerrorLog\n    type=\nElmah.Io.Elasticsearch.ElasticsearchErrorLog, Elmah.Io.Elasticsearch\n\n    connectionStringName=\nElmahIoElasticsearch\n /\n\n\n/elmah\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice something missing? You\u2019re right! The connection string to Elasticsearch specified in line 4. That little sucker is actually a name pointer to a standard connection string in the web.config:\n\n\nconnectionStrings\n\n  \nadd name=\nElmahIoElasticsearch\n connectionString=\nhttp://localhost:9200\n/\n\n\n/connectionStrings\n\n\n\n\n\nThere you have it. ELMAH is now configured to use Elasticsearch using the Elmah.Io.Elasticsearch package. It doesn\u2019t get much easier than that. You can use the default UI in ELMAH by accessing /elmah.axd in your browser. Doing that can be fine, but doesn\u2019t really provide you with the strong search capabilities that we promissed you earlier. Elasticsearch comes with a UI called Head, which can help you do those funky searched. Unfortunatly you need to install Head yourself, but it\u2019s a no brainer using this \ninstallation guide\n.",

            "text": "The Ultimate ELMAH Tutorial\n\n\nThomas Ardal\n, August 29. 2013\n\n\nThere are a lot of articles trying to explain ELMAH out there, but most of them assume that you already know about ELMAH. This article is an attempt to explain how to get up and running with ELMAH in the simplest possible way.\n\n\nSo let\u2019s start by talking about what ELMAH is. ELMAH is basically a NuGet package for .NET web applications, logging every exception occurring on one or more websites to some storage of your choosing. Unlike other logging frameworks ELMAH will, when configured in its most simple form, log every exception automatically. Sure, there\u2019s an API you can use to log custom errors, but most people only use the automatic part. In this tutorial we will only focus on the basic parts.\n\n\nInstallation\n\n\nThe easiest way of setting up ELMAH is through NuGet.\n\n\nRun the following command:\n\n\nInstall-Package ELMAH\n\n\n\n\n... Or add ELMAH by right-clicking on References:\n\n\n\n\nand search for ELMAH:\n\n\n\n\nClick Install and ELMAH is installed in your project.\n\n\nA lot of configuration has been setup in your web.config, but for now just start your web project. When started, navigate to: http://localhost:port/elmah.axd (replace port with your web applications port number). You should see a website looking like this:\n\n\n\n\nLogging errors\n\n\nIn the default configuration, ELMAH uses an in-memory logger which means that errors on the webserver are logged in-memory only. The in-memory logger is meant for development only and we will look at configuring a persistent logger later in this article.\n\n\nFor now generate a 404 by inputting an URL not found like: http://localhost:port/generate-an-error. Unless you configured custom error pages, the default error page is shown:\n\n\n\n\nBehind the curtain, ELMAH silently hooked into the error event and logged the error.\n\n\nThe error list\n\n\nTry navigating to ELMAH again: http://localhost:port/elmah.axd:\n\n\n\n\nThe error just generated by accessing the illegal URL (/generate-an-error) now shows up on the list. ELMAH shows the most important variables in the table, but if you want the full picture, you can click the Details\u2026 link at the end of the error message. This will show ELMAH\u2019s details view:\n\n\n\n\nThe details view shows you some detailed information about the thrown error. Often you would head straight for the stacktrace, but sometimes debugging is easier if you look at the server variables (cookies, http headers etc.). Scroll down for a view of all the server variables included in the failing HTTP request:\n\n\n\n\nLogging to SQL Server\n\n\nPerfect! Our new error log works as it should. If you can live with errors being logged in-memory, you can finish the tutorial now. However, remember that errors are cleared if your website is recycled or similar. Most people configure one of the supported logger implementations to be able to keep the errors. The chances that you are running a SQL Server are probably larger than any other database, which is why we chose to show the SQL Server logger in this tutorial. Please visit the official ELMAH site for a description of the other loggers.\n\n\nSetting up new loggers typically involve a bit of ELMAH configuration as well as some sort of connection string. Open your web.config file and locate the\n\n\nelement. The formatting may be a bit screwed up, but that is easily fixed by clicking Edit | Advanced | Format Document in Visual Studio. The markup looks like this:\n\n\nelmah\n\n  \n!--\n    See http://code.google.com/p/elmah/wiki/SecuringErrorLogPages for\n    more information on remote access and securing ELMAH.\n  --\n\n  \nsecurity allowRemoteAccess=\nfalse\n /\n\n\n/elmah\n\n\n\n\n\nGo ahead and delete the comment if you like. Notice that no logger configuration is present other than the security element. As mentioned before, ELMAH uses the in-memory logger when no logger has been specified. The allowRemoteAccess=\"false\" attribute on the security elements tells ELMAH not to allow connections to errors other than from localhost. You typically don't want to allow for others to look through you error log, which is why we advise you to keep these security settings. More about this later.\n\n\nTo configure the SQL Server log, add a new error logger like this:\n\n\nelmah\n\n  \nerrorLog type=\nElmah.SqlErrorLog, Elmah\n connectionStringName=\nErrorLog\n/\n\n  \nsecurity allowRemoteAccess=\nfalse\n /\n\n\n/elmah\n\n\n\n\n\nIn line 2 a new element has been added. Every error logger in ELMAH is configured using this element. You can only have one error logger per project. The type attribute tells ELMAH what error logger to use. In this case we use the SqlErrorLog class from the Elmah assembly, which we already added through NuGet. Other error loggers may require you to add additional packages. The SqlErrorLog logger requires another attribute named connectionStringName. Again, different error loggers require different configuration to run. The connectionStringName should point to a SQL connection string name ErrorLog:\n\n\nconnectionStrings\n\n  \nadd\n    name=\nErrorLog\n\n    connectionString=\nData Source=localhost;Initial Catalog=ELMAH;Integrated Security=SSPI;\n\n    providerName=\nSystem.Data.SqlClient\n /\n\n\n/connectionStrings\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this example we chose to configure ELMAH to use its own database named ELMAH located on a SQL Server instance on localhost. We recommend using a separate database for ELMAH, but you can use your existing database if you like.\n\n\nELMAH requires some tables and stored procedures to be created on the configured database. The scripts for ELMAH 1.2 can be found here: \nELMAH v1.2 MS Sql Server DB script\n.\n\n\nManually logging errors\n\n\nOften you want to catch errors before returning an error response to the client. Since ELMAH only logs uncaught exceptions, you need some way of logging errors to ELMAH manually. With ELMAH\u2019s \nErrorSignal\n class we can do exactly that:\n\n\ntry\n{\n    int i = 0;\n    int result = 42 / i;\n}\ncatch (DivideByZeroException e)\n{\n    ErrorSignal.FromCurrentContext().Raise(e);\n}\n\n\n\n\nIn the example above, we use the \nFromCurrentContext\n helper to create a new instance of \nErrorSignal\n. ELMAH also works outside the context of a webserver and in this case, you would simply use the default logger with null as the HTTP context:\n\n\nErrorLog.GetDefault(null).Log(new Error(e));\n\n\n\n\nSecuring the error log\n\n\nWhen installed through NuGet, ELMAH automatically sets the \nallowRemoteAccess\n attribute to \nfalse\n. This means that you're only allowed to access \nelmah.axd\n when running on localhost. Like mentioned previously, it's not recommended to set this to \ntrue\n.\n\n\nTo secure access to elmah.axd, ELMAH supports authorization through the authorization feature in ASP.NET. To allow only a single role to access \nelmah.axd\n, locate the configuration section for \nelmah.axd\nand deny all users except users with the admin role (role name may vary from your setup):\n\n\nlocation path=\nelmah.axd\n\n    \nsystem.web\n\n        \nhttpHandlers\n\n            \nadd verb=\nPOST,GET,HEAD\n\n                 path=\nelmah.axd\n\n                 type=\nElmah.ErrorLogPageFactory, Elmah\n /\n\n        \n/httpHandlers\n\n        \nauthorization\n\n            \nallow roles=\nadmin\n /\n\n            \ndeny users=\n*\n /\n\n        \n/authorization\n\n    \n/system.web\n\n    \nsystem.webServer\n\n        \nhandlers\n\n            \nadd name=\nELMAH\n\n                 verb=\nPOST,GET,HEAD\n\n                 path=\nelmah.axd\n\n                 type=\nElmah.ErrorLogPageFactory, Elmah\n\n                 preCondition=\nintegratedMode\n /\n\n        \n/handlers\n\n    \n/system.webServer\n\n\n/location\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to learn more about securing your ELMAH log, you should ready through the \nELMAH Security and allowRemoteAccess Explained",

This removes an error for good.\n\n\nNavigate to your log settings and select the Actions tab. Beneath this tab you can clear your entire log.\n\n\nUse the Ignore Filter feature to ignore certain errors when they are logged.\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the difference between ELMAH and elmah.io?\n\n\nELMAH stands for Error Logging Modules and Handlers for ASP.NET and is the original and very successful open source project for logging errors from .NET web applications. elmah.io is a cloud service offering logging to the cloud from every web framework already supporting ELMAH.\n\n\nIs elmah.io developed by the guys developing ELMAH?\n\n\nNo. A group of talented developers are maintaining and doing new development of ELMAH. elmah.io is maintained by us, though we love to help out on the ELMAH framework as well. Lucky for us, the maintainers behind ELMAH have been kind enough to send us multiple pull requests on the parts of elmah.io which are open source.\n\n\nIs elmah.io open source?\n\n\nYes and no. The persistence part and the elmah.io website are not open source. We open sourced a couple of the components we have written in order to make elmah.io work, as well as our NuGet package for logging errors to elmah.io.\n\n\nA lot of the internals of elmah.io are based on open source and we love making contributions to other projects.\n\n\nIs elmah.io supported in other languages than .NET?\n\n\nelmah.io builds on top of ELMAH, which is an error logging framework for .NET web applications. Integrating with elmah.io from other languages than .NET is possible, if someone wrote an integration for ELMAH from that language or web framework. If no integrations are there, you can use our API to manually log errors to elmah.io.\n\n\nCan I browse errors from outside elmah.io?\n\n\nThere are a few options for browsing through your errors, without visiting elmah.io:\n\n\n\n\nUsing the Rules tab of the log settings, you can execute custom rules each time a new error occurs. This way you can send yourself an email or make a HTTP request when new errors are logged.\n\n\nELMAH offers an error browser as well. This browser is available by visiting /elmah.axd on your own site.\n\n\nWe\u2019ve developed an \nelmah.io Visual Studio extension\n, making it possible to browse your log(s) from within Visual Studio.\n\n\nFinally we provide an API, making it possible to integrate anything with elmah.io. Please let us know if you build something cool.\n\n\n\n\nInstallation\n\n\nWhich (web)frameworks support elmah.io?\n\n\nIn theory every framework supporting ELMAH also supports elmah.io. We do a lot to test elmah.io with as many frameworks as possible and love blogging about it. Find out how to integrate with elmah.io from various frameworks, by visiting \ndocs.elmah.io\n.\n\n\nThe Input Log Id dialog doesn't show during install. Why not?\n\n\nHard to say, but most likely this issue is caused by one of two reasons:\n\n\n\n\nYou already have elmah.io configuration in your web.config file. Look for the \n element.\n\n\nPowershell does not have sufficient privileges to execute the install.ps1 script from the elmah.io NuGet package. Start Visual Studio as administrator or set \nExecutionPolicy\n.\n\n\n\n\nMy website isn't logging errors to elmah.io. What's wrong?\n\n\nCould be one of many reasons. You should check the following:\n\n\n\n\nYour project references both elmah.dll and elmah.io.dll\n\n\nYour web.config contains the ELMAH config as \ndescribed here\n.\n\n\nYou are referencing the most recent version of the \nelmah.io NuGet package\n.\n\n\nThe server hosting your website is able to invoke HTTPS requests on https://elmah.io/ or https://api.elmah.io/.\n\n\n\n\nPayment\n\n\nIs elmah.io free?\n\n\nNo. We provide 30 days of free trial but after that, you will need to pay if you want to continue to use elmah.io. Even though it would be cool, we cannot host a lot of logs and keep innovate on the platform for free. We really hope that you want to help us keep the releases on elmah.io flowing, by checking out our \nplans and pricing page\n and consider purchasing a paid plan.\n\n\nCan I get back my money if I'm not satisfied?\n\n\nNo. Please try out elmah.io by signing up for the trial plan. When you feel satisfied, upgrade to a paid plan for the full monty.\n\n\nDo I get money back if I cancel my subscription in between payments?\n\n\nNo. We\u2019re working with an external partner to handle payments through elmah.io. Our partner does not support this, yet.",
